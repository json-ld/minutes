<h1 id="topic-1" class="topic">Topic: ISSUE-218: Algorithm specification updates by editors</h1>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: <a href="https://github.com/json-ld/json-ld.org/issues/218">https://github.com/json-ld/json-ld.org/issues/218</a></div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: Let's pick up at 5.10 Compaction Algorithm</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  should we use call time for this?</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  history shows that if we don't, it doesn't happen offline</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  most things are checked, we should be able to get through it in 30 minutes</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  the comment was if we need to describe how a shallow copy is made, as there is a lot of detail.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… Since properties can be added or deleteted, that shouldn't happen.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… Do we need to explain in such detail? Or, just say "create a shallow copy".</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  people might implement it incorrectly. You can't just copy the properties and reference the array; it's actually two-level.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  I think that's too vague. A "two-level shallow copy" raises more questions.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  Perhaps we can say do a "two-level shallow copy"? [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  I think most languages would also copy arrays</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  I think just PHP does this, most other languages don't. Just the keys would be copied, and the arrays referenced.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: 5.12 Inverse Context Creation Subalgorithm</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  similar point; in some steps it is also overly explicit in how to do things.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… As described, I wouldn't understand that it should be a pointer; we should be a bit more explicit that we mean a pointer.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… In this case, it's not a shallow copy.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  this happens a couple of places in the spec where we want to create a temporary variable. We also have the issue where gkellogg would like the algorithms to be described more "mathemetically".</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… Not sure what language we should use. We might say "set to a reference of a member".</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  it would be enough to say "set variable to a reference of the value of key".</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  we could say "reference the value of the key in the map", or "let this variable identify the value of the key in the map"</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  prefer the first form.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>: "reference the value of the key in the map using the variable foo"</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  makes sense.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>: +1</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: Next up is step 3.3.6</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  this is purely editorial. Checks are all negative, it would be easier to be positive ("if there is a type mapping, rather than if there is not a type mapping")</div>
<div class="information">Now on 5.11 IRI Compaction Algorithm</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: suggest dropping the “parent” parameter...</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  about dropping the parent parameter here, and in 5.13</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  this exists so that you don't remove things.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  the question is if you remove the duplicates in term selection or inside the compaction algorithm itself.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… Currently it's done in term selection, which also modifies data. I think it's cleaner to make term selection and IRI compaction to just return information, and leave modification to the compaction algorithm.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… The first one where all duplicates are found is picked, and duplicates are removed.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  my implementation doesn't remove data in term selection.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... There is a flag for removing things, which is set to false when called from term selection.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… The actual removal happens during compaction.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  this means it loops over sub-trees twice.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… My selection is to not pass any data, but just return candidates.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… The final selection is done in compaction.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… If there are property generators, you get back potential property generators and a fallback term.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  this is less algorithmically correct, but seems odd that term-selection doesn't actually select a term.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  it seems to me that term selection should give a single term.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  if you pass the parent, it can do the work for you.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  I'm wary of putting the feature at risk because we've done the work.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  JSON-LD is a better spec w/o property generators, we should mark them as at-risk. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Niklas Lindström</span>:  the amount of work put into it is an indication of how complex it is.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  implementing the algorithms doesn't mean that someone knows what's actually going on.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  I'm concerned about removing such a big feature... we don't have a way of doing that if we remove the feature. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  we need the correct text if we're going to take it to LC. If it's going to be dropped, we can just stop discussion.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  the timing is the thing.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… This would delay LC while we re-write the algorithms, after asking lin and scor.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  perhaps just talk about things other than property generators?</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: 5.13 Term Selection Subalgorithm, second checkbox</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  dave used this to say if it is explicitly set to null or something else. I think it would be easier to just use @null.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  I think there was a test-case where the difference in language mattered; perhaps default language.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  my algorithm is almost exactly the same, and I just use @null. I can't see where it would actually matter.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  if there were two terms, one used a null language, and the other didn't, you'd need to be sure you didn't loose that.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… It might be to simplify existence checks. We could change to check for existence of entries instead.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… I'll take a look at it and try to clean it up.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  next comment is if variables should be different.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  to address your concern about copy/paste into comments, they should add quotes to make sure it's clear.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  this was brought up by prototypo, I just want to be sure it's covered.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  we could update ReSpec to add hidden back-ticks around variables, so that they show up when copy/pasting.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  I'll look into supporting something that makes this simpler in ReSpec [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div id="action-1" class="action">ACTION: Gregg to look at adding support in ReSpec for auto-quoting variable names in algorithms.</div>
<div class="information">Next up: 5.14 Value Compaction</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  I think it was a difference of opinion on what the style should be.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… One does a copy, the other doesn't and doesn't change things until it needs to.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  let's just not discuss value compaction now.</div>
<h1 id="topic-2" class="topic">Topic: JSON-LD Property Generators</h1>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  it sounded like there was concensus to remove before LC.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… We should discuss with scor and lin, but the group would like to remove it due to the great complexity added.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Paul Kuykendall</span>:  how would this affect the actual RDF being created? Is it just a shortcut to not have to repeat yourself.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… I see that we have a use-case that could make use of this, for example, when building out ontologies so that we can merge.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  use case has to do with transforming to RDF?</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Paul Kuykendall</span>:  we're using JSON-LD more like JSON/RDF structure. We're generating some ontologies that define the business domain and trying to tie them to other existing ontologies (dc, schema, etc.).</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… to allow customers better access into the data.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… For example, we have our own internal structure for "address", which has a lot of cominality, using sameProperty within the ontologies, that is expressed in the code.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… To say that these are the same thing.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… We to SPARQL inference in the client, and they then parse out what they need.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  is it read-only?</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Paul Kuykendall</span>:  they can write back. It may be SPARQL Update in the future.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  Well, the support you're showing for it might mean we have to keep this feature... even if we don't like it that much. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  you said you're defining ontologies, and mapping them to DC, Schema and so forth?</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Paul Kuykendall</span>:  yes; However, the clients don't necessarily know about this mapping, as we can hide things behind the scene.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… If it turns out that they're really a bad idea, it's early enough in our cycle that we could change.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  the only change, if we drop property generators, you would have to be explicit about having three different properties.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Paul Kuykendall</span>:  the concern is that you have data-duplication that it populates all of them and reduces the chanse of programmer error.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… Making sure that all copies are updated, rather than just one of three copies.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  one of the problems with PG's is that if the client expands and only changes one of the values, it wouldn't compact back again.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Niklas Lindström</span>:  it is duplication, just hidden.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Paul Kuykendall</span>:  we use compacted form between client and server.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… If I had the incorrect notion, maybe we should take this out, so we don't have a mis-interpretation.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  there is nothing passed to tell how to re-compact, just the values need to be the same.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Niklas Lindström</span>: .. <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-syntax/#vocabulary-expansion">http://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-syntax/#vocabulary-expansion</a></div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Paul Kuykendall</span>:  that sounds like a great reason to get rid of them, as it might be deceptively simple and create more problems later on.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Niklas Lindström</span>:  describes RDFa mechanism for vocabulary expansion.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Paul Kuykendall</span>:  My mis-understandings implies that other people might also be confused about property generators.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  there is no easy solution to your use-case. The alternatives might actually be worse than property generators.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>: hi lin</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>: we are currently discussing whether to drop property generators for 1.0</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  either way, your application is going to have to keep track of what properties go together.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Wondering about possible future use of property-generators in Drupal.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Lin Clark</span>:  at this point, I don't think they're a requirement for us.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… We're focusing our use of JSON-LD to aligning ...</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… We're not necessarily optimizing for smaller size, so it should be okay from our stand-point.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  seems like paul has a use case, but PGs don't fully express it, and there is a fair chance of making things worse.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… Lin's use case has found a different solution.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… At this point, it doesn't seem we have anyone that really needs them.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  easier to remove now and re-introduce later than the other way around.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Niklas Lindström</span>:  they border so much on semantics, that people can use things like vocabulary expansion to do the same thing. It's not syntactic, but semantically, it's already defined.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  I think the only way for them to work in the future if we allow updates would be to include something in expanded form, but for everyone converting to RDF, it wouldn't work.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… People would have to program to understand the special relationships between properties.</div>

<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: <a href="https://github.com/json-ld/json-ld.org/issues/221">https://github.com/json-ld/json-ld.org/issues/221</a></div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  a new feature requested, with a couple of implementations.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... Of course, we're well past feature-freeze, even if they seem simple to add.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Niklas Lindström</span>:  I've been using it since 2011, and at the National Library I come across it all the time.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… Today, we abstracted people for which there exist not descriptions, but we want to record the relationship anyway. For example createorOr. There are no such properties, so using ^creator allows us to express this.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… Not all vocabularies define inverse properties, and certain disciplines frown on explicitly defining inverses of properties.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… you naturally create things over time, you link a book to an author, and don't always update the author to link back to the book.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… I've felt needs for links to objects, such as RDF/SPARQL Constructur results, or CBD's, where I want to root the description in the primary object, and have things that link to/from this.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… Filter authors/works, and works/authors. In many expressions, it's useful to say the inversee.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  Curious if you've implemented the round-tripping bits of this? [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… I haven't implemented round-tripping in the code I have so far. It's been a while, and I think I had something working in the past.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… It seemed fairly simple to do, as long as you don't define both to and from forms.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>: <a href="http://bit.ly/Xfy5vO">http://bit.ly/Xfy5vO</a></div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  I implementier compaction, and it's quite triveal.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… (example provided.)</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… children expands to parent.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… It also takes into consideration if there is @reverse in the data.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Niklas Lindström</span>:  this cleanly solves the two variants I had in the past, but this is cleaner.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… I'd like to see it as you've implemented it.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Paul Kuykendall</span>:  we also have some use cases we're using on where we need support for inverse relationships.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… We had to do a work around where we do inferencing on the client side to look for inverse relationships, so it can understand what properties to set.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… We do have a way around it, but this would be a nice to have feature.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… We have a (barley adequate) workaround, but we need something different.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  would it be enough to create a description of how it works, not include in JSON-LD 1.0, but all implementations have the feature.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… Or, we have an implementation, and Markus could put his algorithm in there, but we run a risk of standardizing something that doesn't work for everyone.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  I'm concerned that we might be putting this into the spec before it's ready. I have some other feature additions that might need further thought. Trying to solve everything at this point is a recipe for disaster. I think we need to embrace an "open specification" approach, and close the door on JSON-LD 1.0 Core in order to allow in order for people to start using it. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  We can start adding features after that... easier to put it in later than add it in now and possibly remove it later. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Niklas Lindström</span>:  it isn't new from my perspective, and is a very natural feature when you express graphs as trees.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… We also have the BBC use, which is what brought this up.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  would having it spec'd out elsewhere be enough?</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… How many years before JSON-LD 1.1?</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… If it's broadly implemented, it doesn't really matter if it's in the core spec.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  other specs would not be compliant, as they must otherwise drop such properties or values.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… There are some special cases (no @id and @reverse), but it's about an afternoon to make it solid.</div>

<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  I use stuff like that to specify that things should be able to be expressed via relative IRIs... it makes the document work if it's served via any location. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… this would allow for the use of IRIs, so you'd keep relative IRIs.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… (reverses scribe's understanding).</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… If you use @base "" it means to not change them, relative IRIs come in and go back out, for example in @id.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  What happens if you do this? '../test/.../hello' does it get compacted to this? '../hello' ? [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  should be no changes. If you specify @base: "", make no changes to IRIs on input.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… This does not rule out using terms and @id.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… My preference is to do no processing at all; a way of saying "don't touch my IDs"</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  I don't know how standard this is, how many other serializations say don't touch IRIs.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… Not doing path normalization might be a problem.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  can we stay silent?</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  we need a test-case for it.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Niklas Lindström</span>: .. "you can also pass an empty string and see what happens" ;)</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  if we do this sort of normalization, it will impact normalization algorithms.</div>

<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  my read of the specs, is that paths would be resolved.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  we link to the spec, and say that.</div>

<div class="proposal"><strong>PROPOSAL:</strong> Allow @base to be set to the empty string. If @base is set to the empty string, relative IRIs are processed according to RFC 3986 Section 5.2.2 (which is how they're always processed in JSON-LD).</div>

<div class="comment"><span class="name">Paul Kuykendall</span>: Is the diff-marked version broken here? <a href="http://json-ld.org/spec/latest/json-ld-api/">http://json-ld.org/spec/latest/json-ld-api/</a></div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: The diff-marked version for the live spec is always broken, you can try using the 'diffmark tool' in the live version of the spec.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>: Try doing this: CTRL+SHIFT+ALT+S then click on 'diffmark'</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Paul Kuykendall</span>:  we're fixing our APIs to be closer to the latest spec, would be nice to know what changed.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  You're probably going to have to save a local copy and run the 'htmldiff.pl' script between the version you used to implement and the current version (saved as a static file via CTRL-SHIFT-ALT-S).</div>
