[10:07]	<taaz>	manu1: I read through every issue this weekend and put proposal on as many as possible.
[10:07]	<taaz>	manu1: [discussion of super sesssion next week]
[10:08]	<manu1>	Topic: ISSUE-46: Absolute IRI detection

[10:09]	<voip-ld>	Added niklasl to the speaker queue: niklasl
[10:09]	<manu1>	ack niklasl
[10:09]	<voip-ld>	niklasl has the floor. The speaker queue is empty.

[10:17]	<manu1>	PROPOSAL: If a key in a JSON-LD document contains a colon, it is a CompactIRI if the prefix is defined as a term in the active context, otherwise it is an AbsoluteIRI. The only exception to this rule is if "//" follows the first colon, and in that case, the value is an AbsoluteIRI.

[10:21]	<manu1>	RESOLVED: If a key in a JSON-LD document contains a colon, it is a CompactIRI if the prefix is defined as a term in the active context, otherwise it is an AbsoluteIRI. The only exception to this rule is if "//" follows the first colon, and in that case, the value is an AbsoluteIRI.
[10:21]	<manu1>	Clarification - you always split on the first colon. The rule only applies to the first colon detected in a CURIE, all subsequent colons are allowed.

[10:28]	<taaz>	(sorry, my net connection went away for 20 mins there)
[10:28]	<gkellogg>	We discussed this in issue 40: https://github.com/json-ld/json-ld.org/issues/40
[10:30]	<taaz>	manu1: Do we want to be that accurate/pedantic about this. @type used in coersion, set in rdf type, and to set type of a value.
[10:31]	<taaz>	manu1: Is using set in list going to far?
[10:31]	<niklasl>	.. "@type": {"@list": "xsd:date"}

[10:38]	<manu1>	PROPOSAL: Adopt "@container": "@list" syntax to specify container coercion to an ordered list when specified via the @context.
