<h1 id="topic-1" class="topic">Topic: JSON-LD in the News</h1>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  JSON-LD got good coverage at the W3C Social Standards Workshop</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… Announcements from IBM, and schema.org actions.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: schema.org is now using JSON-LD to describe some of their data: <a href="http://schema.org/Action">http://schema.org/Action</a></div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">David Booth</span>: Lots of discussion at Social Web meetup about JSON-LD: <a href="http://www.w3.org/2013/socialweb/">http://www.w3.org/2013/socialweb/</a></div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… schema using JSON-LD as they have found people have problems with microdata/RDFa</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… As a result ActivityStreams started looking at JSON-LD.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: Shane Becker said JSON-LD was unnecessary: <a href="http://iamshane.com/articles/2013/8/8/1/json-ld-is-an-uneeded-spec">http://iamshane.com/articles/2013/8/8/1/json-ld-is-an-uneeded-spec</a></div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… subsequently micro formats community took exception, saying it was an "unneeded specification"</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… (Doesn't look like they actually read the spec).</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: I countered Shane's post here: <a href="http://manu.sporny.org/2013/json-ld-is-the-bees-knees/">http://manu.sporny.org/2013/json-ld-is-the-bees-knees/</a></div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… That was picked up and re-tweeted a bit, so I wrote a blog entry to debunk it</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: Ade Oshineye wrote this post on JSON-LD <a href="https://plus.google.com/+AdeOshineye/posts/8BAahV1gQUk">https://plus.google.com/+AdeOshineye/posts/8BAahV1gQUk</a></div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>: Dan Brickley started working on some soundcloud markup: <a href="https://gist.github.com/danbri/6210802">https://gist.github.com/danbri/6210802</a></div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>: Link above was a response Dan Brickley was working on for marking up the recording info requested by Ade</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… Ade at google wrote a post liking to shane's article</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… Conversations allow an opportunity to talk more about the motivations of JSON-LD</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  The whole Activity stuff wrt. Google - it was not well received at all, it made it seem like they were ignoring Activity Streams community. Guha came to defend schema.org and dispel myths and was not very effective at that. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  schema.org wasn't viewed nicely - they were kinda ignoring Activity Streams. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  we may want to think about distancing ourselves from schema.org and other initiatives; we've seen this happen before with RDFa.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… our strategy has been to talk about JSON-LD use anywhere.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… We don't want to pick sides.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  One of my responses on Twitter, wrt. Microformats people, what it does w/ vocabularies - JSON-LD is vocabulary agnostic, Microformats isn't. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  MF is making some change about separating vocabulary from markup, but there is very little activity within that community now.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  There is also a fair amount of presence by the IndieWeb community, Tantek being the main person there... they showed off some cool social media tech - indieauth... effective way to bring many communities together. Great forum for JSON-LD. Nothing we really need to do to follow up. Wouldn't worry about any of the schema.org stuff that came up there. They're such a big player that people are going to take shots at them. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<h1 id="topic-2" class="topic">Topic: David Booth's Editorial Comments</h1>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-linked-json/2013Aug/0025.html">http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-linked-json/2013Aug/0025.html</a></div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  dbooth had sent out some minor changes to the Syntax and API specs.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">David Booth</span>:  just editorial changes to smooth out some language.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… Text says it's a "generalized RDF dataset", but by default, it's standard. It also start talking about extensions before saying that there are extensions.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  gkellogg and I reviewed the spec and could integrate it.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  is it true that it serializes a standard dataset? It does allow you to put in blank nodes.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  It's not syntactically invalid to use blank nodes in predicate positions like it is in TURTLE, so it can be serialized, but it does not result in those blank nodes being emitted when you turn it into RDF. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">David Booth</span>:  if the spec only constrains the end-result, then the end-result is standard RDF unless the option is specified.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  I can see it both ways; I don't think the proposed change will make a big difference.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  the description is somehow incompatible with the data model described in the spec.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  I think dbooth's approach is to talk about serialization, and that is data model, so we're going to have differences.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  the only place blank nodes are dropped is if you emit RDF.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  is this paragraph about JSON or RDF?</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  deserializing to an abstract syntax is the wrong term.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">David Booth</span>:  maybe we can move "optionally" before "serialize".</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  let me look into it more and try to tweak the wording.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… We'll try to change the text to address both dbooth's and markus' objections.</div>
<h1 id="topic-3" class="topic">Topic: Update on GSoC from Vikash</h1>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-linked-json/2013Aug/0026.html">http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-linked-json/2013Aug/0026.html</a></div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Vikash Agrawal</span>:  I shared an update this week. Markus had some issues within the schema, as it did not include all classes and properties in schema.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>: bye dbooth</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… using @vocab of <a href="http://schema.org/">http://schema.org/</a> means that specifying other vocabulary terms is not vital.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… I've moved on to the LinkedIn application.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… A question: I get JSON from LinkedIn, should I display that or a modified version?</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… This could be the last coding project for the summer, then I could go on to documentation.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  regarding the schema.org context, markus said it's not complete, but we had decided to just focus on the properties needed for specific classes.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… We'll need to eventually replace that with something machine generated; it shouldn't be that difficult to go through the schema and translate it.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  perhaps a bonus project would be to do an algorithmic transformation of the vocabulary to JSON-LD context, and make it better.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Vikash Agrawal</span>:  I would go through a python crawler to retrieve it?</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  fetching a document from schema.org and transforming it into JSON-LD automatically, as the vocabulary will be updated over time. Having to do this manually is not a good long-term strategy.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Vikash Agrawal</span>:  so, I would get it every time it updates and re-generate the context definition.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  don't worry about that now, we'll come back to it later.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Vikash Agrawal</span>:  the creator tool is done, and there are some validations left to perform.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  sounds like you're going to work on the creator tool and LinkedIn app.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… don't work on the schema.org context anymore, and maybe come back to it later.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… The w3.org redirection is fine.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… the creator tool is a good first pass; we need to make the tool more generalized, so we can plug in different types of things. We'd like to do Organizations and other schema types, so they can't be hard-coded.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… The first pass was all that we asked for; one of the things you could do in the future would be to make it generic, for example having a JSON-LD file to describe the types and form elements.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Vikash Agrawal</span>:  Do you want me to make the creator tool more generic? Add those options you mentioned?</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  don't worry about them now, when you're done, we can come back to it.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… Is LinkedIn application published anywhere?</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Vikash Agrawal</span>:  for LinkedIn, I won't be able to publish. If possible, you need to pull it down and test it on a local machine, so it can't be deployed (?)</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… what should be presented in the application?</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  the ideal tool would allow you to put in a LinkedIn profile name, fetch the JSON, convert to JSON-LD and return it in a text-box.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Vikash Agrawal</span>:  I was thinking that after signing it, user would see both JSON and JSON-LD, or we could just show JSON-LD with computations in the background.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  just show JSON-LD, but could have an "advanced" tab to show original JSON, but hide it by default.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  isn't the idea for the JSON-LD to look just like the JSON you got with an @context?</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  I was thinkingg it would be translated to schema.org markup, we would do the transformation.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  it might be good to see the JSON-LD just using a context, and then after you've converted it to schema.org.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  my understanding of the purpose of the code is just to allow people to see their data as JSON-LD</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  why wouldn't we want it to look as much as the original JSON as possible?</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  the data they publish is not very intuitive. The primary use case is schema.org, not LinkedIn.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  other people might want to reused the context for other uses.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  that belongs in an advanced tab.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… I was hoping that people would just copy and paste the JSON-LD and put it into a file on their website, or into a script tag in their profile page.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Vikash Agrawal</span>:  an advanced tab would be a good way to do it.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  Meta comment - your audio has been very difficult to understand, probably because you're not using a headset and possibly bandwidth issues. Please try to get a headset. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Vikash Agrawal</span>:  I've had some problems with my data plan.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  I think the major problem is the lack of a headset.</div>
<h1 id="topic-4" class="topic">Topic: Review of JSON-LD 1.0 CR-ready specification</h1>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: <a href="http://json-ld.org/spec/latest/json-ld/">http://json-ld.org/spec/latest/json-ld/</a></div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  I prepped a spec last week for CR, including everything but dbooth's updates</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… I think the CR spec is ready to go from an editorial perspective.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  my comment is that people have complained about overloading @type, either because they haven't read it, or it requires some more explanation.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  the problem is that people aren't really reading the spec.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  we could mark the use of @type in the context as at risk and introduce @datatype in the future.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  that's not the problem.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  then the issue is a reading comprehension problem.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… they're not reading enough to know the difference. We've always had this issue.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Niklas Lindström</span>:  The problem is that the overloading of @type isn't carried through because we treat the concept of datatypes as something different than RDF types.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… Would @datatype change the distinction?</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… It might address the problem unless people start to use @type instead of @datatype.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… OTOH, using @coerce in the context imply that people don't really think about type, but values.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… we could use @value instead of @type in the context</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  or allow @type to be used for data-injection, as people have assumed.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  round-rripping becomes problematic, because we wouldn't know if to remove the type later</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Niklas Lindström</span>:  that would mean that we could only do this for types, and not other properties.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… I would be fine with introducing @coerce, or @value</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  @coerce might have a similar problem</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  we might need a different keyword</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Niklas Lindström</span>:  the keyword should imply: "treat the string value as something other than a string"</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  just put an @ sign in front of that phrase!</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Niklas Lindström</span>: .. @coercevalue</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>: @interpretAs @interpret</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… Let's put an issue marker next to this indicating that we might introduce a new keyword. Once people learn it, they don't forget it.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Niklas Lindström</span>:  could we propose to examine the possibility of another keyword.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  what problem are we trying to solve? People don't know the different of types in statements or literals, this doesn't change that.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: we could do @literalType</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… People understand this once it is explained, and will resolve itself</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Niklas Lindström</span>:  I think the use of @type in context does introduce a threshold which will never go away and will be a hurdle. I find it a bit strange when I look at the data. We have other specific keywords which send a specific signal.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… When I see @id and @type together, you have to wonder what it means.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  We should try to add an "explain" feature to the playground, which would go line by line to describe what the data means.</div>
<div class="proposal"><strong>PROPOSAL:</strong> Add an issue marker for @type stating that we may introduce a new keyword to do literal type coercion.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Niklas Lindström</span>: +1</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: +1</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>: +1</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Vikash Agrawal</span>: +1 (surely)</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  +0.2</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>: -0.9</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Niklas Lindström</span>: (.. e.g. "@type": "@id" vs. "@coerce": "@id")</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  I don't think it will address the issue and just trigger more confusion.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>: changing mine to a -1</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  by not putting it in the spec, it could cost us another 4 weeks. By putting into the spec, it enables us to change.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Vikash Agrawal</span>: Can we have @expandTo</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  even if we add an issue marker, I think we would have to go back to LC</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  no, that's not how the W3C process works. you're allowed to do this if you've used an issue marker.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  this looks like the API issue that put is back into LC</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  we're not into LC anymore, so the rules are different. We wouldn't actually need to go back to LC.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… The reason for this is to prevent from going from CR back to LC.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Niklas Lindström</span>: .. also, recall that berjon first problem in the examples was "@type": "@id"..</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  my vote is for least-friction, whatever that might be</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>: +1</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  I'm willing to trigger more discussions if this will help.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Niklas Lindström</span>:  if manu isn't correct, then I expect markus and dlongley to actually vote -1 to making the change, if it comes to that.</div>
<div id="resolution-1" class="resolution"><strong>RESOLUTION:</strong> Add an issue marker for @type stating that we may introduce a new keyword to do literal type coercion.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  my assumption is that we won't make a change.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  danbri was confused about @type: @id, if you're expecting a URL or an object or array of objects (which you can).</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  Confusion there may be about type casting may work on things that are not bare strings... type casting is only meant to apply to strings. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  same for @language</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  it could be to say "if a string is found in the value position, it will be used to interpret that". Highlighting that fact might be helpful.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… If you look at example 3, it's misleading.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… It should say if a string is encountered as a value, it should be interpreted as an IRI</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  I had that in spec-text before, but it was a lot to swallow in the 3rd example.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… It's going to be difficult for people to understand why we're being so specific.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  I don't think we need to make a lot of substantial changes, we could just say "if the values are strings, they can be interpreted as IRIs.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… We could say that in the example, and in the paragraph after the example.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… it's only a couple of words.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Niklas Lindström</span>: .. something like "This means that any string associated with 'image' shall be interpreted as an object with this string as its identifier"?</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  I'm dubious that it will help, but fine in putting in some text.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  also after example 10, we could change the "even though …" text a bit to "since ..."</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… text after example 3, 4 and 10</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Niklas Lindström</span>:  I'm concerned about how we say that things are interpreted as IRIs. We really mean that it implies there's an object with that identifier. People already know that a string can be an IRI</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… I think we're a bit in "RDF mode" in our minds, if they instead thought of the string as representing an object with an @id key.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  these are editorial changes, which can be made after CR. We should focus on changes that need to be done before CR.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  any concern about JSON-LD 1.0 spec for CR?</div>

<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  had a question about exit criteria, which was taken from another spec.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… Also about @context, on how it can be accepted. The only thing that isn't support is an array of objects having @context.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… We could support this, but it would need to change the API algorithms.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… This could mean that some problems wouldn't be found.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… You could embed a context with another context, which would be problematic</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  is there a major use case we're missing?</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  I really don't see a use case, just what you presented last week, but that can be implemented quite easily.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… It's really about allowing some syntactic sugar which isn't currently allowed.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  my implementation allows it, but I don't really care that much. Markus is right that you could do this in pre-processing pretty easily.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  I think it's safe to not add at this point, we can always come back to it in the future.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… I have some concerns about the explanations of each section. Since it's the API spec, I don't think it's super critically, but we might want to make language more accessible during and after CR</div>
