[2017-11-08 13:14:24] <bigbluehat> present+
[2017-11-08 13:14:36] <azaroth> David:  Are the additions just supplementary, or changes semantics?
[2017-11-08 13:14:37] <takeshi> present+

[2017-11-08 13:15:15] <azaroth> ... Previously container was limited to 4 values. Now we have a new value space for container.
[2017-11-08 13:15:37] <azaroth> ... so for compatibility, a 1.1 processor and sees it in 1.0 mode will complain
[2017-11-08 13:16:09] <azaroth> david_wood: Versioned MIME 1.0 -- intention to later come up with 1.1.  Unexpectedly, the process of versioning caused MIME to never increase its version
[2017-11-08 13:16:18] <azaroth> ... built into so many tools
[2017-11-08 13:16:31] <ivan> present+
[2017-11-08 13:16:31] <azaroth> ... With schema.org and other usage, what barriers are there practically for adoption?
[2017-11-08 13:16:41] <azaroth> ... brought up a couple already, are there others?
[2017-11-08 13:16:43] <betehess> depending on what could be broken when 1.0 processors read @version 1.1, maybe it would make sense to use 2.0 instead of 1.1
[2017-11-08 13:17:00] <betehess> depends on expectations
[2017-11-08 13:17:06] <azaroth> gkellogg: New keys can confuse 1.0 and 1.1 implementations.  If this property was used, 1.1 would interpret the data differently
[2017-11-08 13:17:38] <azaroth> ... need to face what that means as a community.  Far fewer implementations of the processor than the uses of the language, we could choose to simply say we're cutting off the 1.0 features or restrictions
[2017-11-08 13:17:54] <bigbluehat> q?
[2017-11-08 13:17:54] — Zakim sees no one on the speaker queue
[2017-11-08 13:17:58] <azaroth> ivan: Far fewer code implementations, but no idea how often it's used.  Forcing an upgrade
[2017-11-08 13:18:19] <azaroth> Manu: Kingsley sent me an email 2 days ago, just tried yoru 1.1 context and it blew up on me. ... what are we doing?
[2017-11-08 13:18:25] <azaroth> ... that was a good thing as it was a 1.0 processor
[2017-11-08 13:18:40] <azaroth> ... Good for it to blow up as there are features we absolutely need
[2017-11-08 13:18:55] <azaroth> ... His digital signature would be just wrong

[2017-11-08 13:19:48] <azaroth> gkellogg: How does a CG manage it?  Need a working group.
[2017-11-08 13:19:56] <azaroth> ???" RDF 1.1 was a WG though
[2017-11-08 13:20:07] <azaroth> David:  Was standardized in a WG
[2017-11-08 13:20:13] <azaroth> Ivan: Don't see a problem

[2017-11-08 13:20:36] <azaroth> ivan: If its successful, take it to WG and the version will be decided
[2017-11-08 13:20:46] <azaroth> ... agree with alexandre that 2.0 sends a new message
[2017-11-08 13:20:52] <bigbluehat> +1 to calling it 2.0 (or just 2)
[2017-11-08 13:20:55] <azaroth> ... rdf 1.1 is incremental, nothign radical

[2017-11-08 13:21:06] <fab_gandon> Fabien: it is ok to do 1.1 or 2.0 in a CG or WG
[2017-11-08 13:21:10] <azaroth> cwebber2: Agree with Manu that it should have blown up in that circumstance
[2017-11-08 13:21:29] <azaroth> ... don't want someone using schema who it was using it in prod, don't want it to randomly blow up

[2017-11-08 13:21:56] <azaroth> ... learnt lesson in activitypub/streams, if you add a new term to a context, and had a cached context, it wouldn't validate

[2017-11-08 13:22:00] — Zakim sees kimhd, bigbluehat on the speaker queue
[2017-11-08 13:22:35] <azaroth> ... doesn't change this, but might be worth encouraging. Good to version contexts... schema.org + some version identifier.  Can wait to update to that version when your code is ready
[2017-11-08 13:22:36] <azaroth> q?
[2017-11-08 13:22:36] — Zakim sees kimhd, bigbluehat on the speaker queue
[2017-11-08 13:22:42] <azaroth> ... should start pushing more
[2017-11-08 13:22:47] <azaroth> ack kimhd
[2017-11-08 13:22:47] — Zakim sees bigbluehat on the speaker queue
[2017-11-08 13:23:05] <azaroth> kimhd:  Abstracted from just JSON -- does that change RDF canonicalization
[2017-11-08 13:23:10] <azaroth> david: I did not pay her :D
[2017-11-08 13:23:10] <bigbluehat> q-
[2017-11-08 13:23:10] — Zakim sees no one on the speaker queue
[2017-11-08 13:23:20] <azaroth> gkellogg: canonicalization happens at the rdf abstract model level
[2017-11-08 13:23:37] → grisha joined (~grisha@public.cloak)
[2017-11-08 13:23:37] <azaroth> ... if your data is in YAML, you might eg have whitespace issues ... but also in RDF/XML
[2017-11-08 13:23:41] <ivan> q?
[2017-11-08 13:23:41] — Zakim sees no one on the speaker queue
[2017-11-08 13:23:42] <azaroth> ... no different barriers
[2017-11-08 13:23:44] <ivan> q+
[2017-11-08 13:23:44] — Zakim sees ivan on the speaker queue
[2017-11-08 13:24:06] <azaroth> ... turning JSON-LD into RDF for normalization goes through the algorithms that parse the syntax into an intermediate form, that you then run alogithms on
[2017-11-08 13:24:31] <azaroth> ... just a different surface syntax.  Can be used where the target model can go to that structure
[2017-11-08 13:24:38] <azaroth> david:  What about framing?
[2017-11-08 13:24:47] <azaroth> ivan: just syntactic sugar.
[2017-11-08 13:24:52] <azaroth> gkellogg: Can be used to filter
[2017-11-08 13:25:08] <azaroth> d longley:  If you filter, you can change the canonical representation by filtering
[2017-11-08 13:25:10] <azaroth> q?
[2017-11-08 13:25:10] — Zakim sees ivan on the speaker queue
[2017-11-08 13:25:20] <cwebber2> q?
[2017-11-08 13:25:20] — Zakim sees ivan on the speaker queue
[2017-11-08 13:25:40] <azaroth> gkellogg: Included the index which does not round trip
[2017-11-08 13:25:44] <azaroth> ack ivan
[2017-11-08 13:25:44] — Zakim sees no one on the speaker queue
[2017-11-08 13:25:54] — cwebber2 notes that it's a syntactic sugar issue *if* you're considering it as a graph, but not syntactic sugar to many of json-ld's *users* who don't think of json-ld as a graph
[2017-11-08 13:25:57] <azaroth> ivan:  JSONLD for me is yet another RDF serialization.
[2017-11-08 13:26:00] <cwebber2> q?
[2017-11-08 13:26:00] — Zakim sees no one on the speaker queue
[2017-11-08 13:26:10] <azaroth> ... Still true?
[2017-11-08 13:26:16] <azaroth> dlongley: Yes
[2017-11-08 13:26:24] <azaroth> bigbluehat: But not round trip everything like index

[2017-11-08 13:27:15] — Zakim sees no one on the speaker queue
[2017-11-08 13:27:21] <azaroth> ... (round tripping meaning)
[2017-11-08 13:27:25] <reto> q+
[2017-11-08 13:27:25] — Zakim sees reto on the speaker queue
[2017-11-08 13:27:50] — bigbluehat we should put gkellogg on the queue ^_^
[2017-11-08 13:28:05] <azaroth> gkellogg: Definitely need to leave it as an issue. Good discussion here, in issue, and hopefully in a WG
[2017-11-08 13:28:17] — cwebber2 bigbluehat: haha
[2017-11-08 13:28:57] <azaroth> reto: One issue was a huge file that couldnt' be parsed.  Worked with a developer, JSON-LD looks a bit different, then people have a problem.  Google structured data -- put examples in and there are errors
[2017-11-08 13:29:22] <azaroth> ... if you look at it like JSON, then can be surprised when things can mean the same thing and look differently
[2017-11-08 13:29:41] <azaroth> ivan: Two JSON-LD are equivalent if the RDF is euivalent, but files can be very different
[2017-11-08 13:29:48] <azaroth> ... hard to understand if you don't have the background
[2017-11-08 13:30:11] — cwebber2 don't tell json people that though until they get on the json-ld boat ;)
[2017-11-08 13:30:13] <azaroth> David_wood: JSON and JSON-LD have idfferent data models -- LD is explicit, JSON is implicit
[2017-11-08 13:30:42] <azaroth> gkellogg: (slides)  ID maps -- keys of URIs that reference the description of the identified resource
[2017-11-08 13:30:59] <azaroth> ... these are equivalent to an array of two objects with @id in the objects
[2017-11-08 13:31:16] <cwebber2> q+
[2017-11-08 13:31:16] — Zakim sees reto, cwebber on the speaker queue
[2017-11-08 13:31:18] <azaroth> ... round trippable. If you compact with a context that doesn't have a container id, then you get array. If you add it, you get the object
[2017-11-08 13:31:30] <azaroth> ???: That's by virtue of the URL?
[2017-11-08 13:31:42] <azaroth> gkellogg: The @container: @id makes this explicit
[2017-11-08 13:31:43] <azaroth> q?
[2017-11-08 13:31:43] — Zakim sees reto, cwebber on the speaker queue

[2017-11-08 13:31:55] — Zakim sees no one on the speaker queue
[2017-11-08 13:32:41] <azaroth> gkellogg: Also a parallel that lets you have container type -- the indexes are treated as the value of @type for the object
[2017-11-08 13:33:11] <azaroth> dlongley: graph container as well
[2017-11-08 13:33:33] <azaroth> gkellogg: nested properties -- microdata representation has JSON structure between entities and properties
[2017-11-08 13:34:02] <azaroth> ... so added a sugary nesting property.  labels: @nest means when you expand the data, collapse the values back to the entity
[2017-11-08 13:34:13] <azaroth> ivan: What does it mean?
[2017-11-08 13:34:21] <azaroth> gkellogg: Ignore the nesting
[2017-11-08 13:34:29] <azaroth> dlongley:  labels has no meaning in the data model.
[2017-11-08 13:34:38] ⇐ rdeltour quit (~rdeltour@public.cloak): rdeltour
[2017-11-08 13:34:40] <azaroth> gkellogg: an object with two labels.
[2017-11-08 13:35:08] <azaroth> bigbluehat: really valuable -- run into this in JSON a lot -- want it packaged in this way for devs
[2017-11-08 13:35:33] <azaroth> ivan: something like comments or annotations

[2017-11-08 13:36:00] — Zakim sees reto on the speaker queue
[2017-11-08 13:36:05] — bigbluehat how about @descendIntoTheVoid?
[2017-11-08 13:36:15] <azaroth> (...) discussion about @nest as a name
[2017-11-08 13:36:18] — cwebber2 I guess if you have two @nests with the same key
[2017-11-08 13:36:19] — bigbluehat ...or maybe just @descend...or something
[2017-11-08 13:36:25] — cwebber2 it will hit a naming conflict?
[2017-11-08 13:36:28] <azaroth> drummond: Strictly for the format
[2017-11-08 13:36:30] — betehess would suggest @skip :-D
[2017-11-08 13:36:33] <azaroth> ... are there other things like that?
[2017-11-08 13:36:38] — bigbluehat cwebber2 there's a queue. you should get on it and ask that. ;)
[2017-11-08 13:36:42] <cwebber2> q+

[2017-11-08 13:36:44] <azaroth> gkellogg: Other things are to take json idioms
[2017-11-08 13:36:50] <azaroth> ... and generally round trip
[2017-11-08 13:36:54] — bigbluehat betehess but what about @hop?! ;-P
[2017-11-08 13:36:55] <azaroth> ... this won't survive a round trip
[2017-11-08 13:37:03] <azaroth> q?

[2017-11-08 13:37:37] <azaroth> cwebber: Can definitely see using this
[2017-11-08 13:38:15] <azaroth> ... if you have two of them, and they have the same keys, do they go?
[2017-11-08 13:38:28] <azaroth> gkellogg: No, you end up in an array. Just not round trip to the right places
[2017-11-08 13:38:31] — betehess bigbluehat @hop works for me
[2017-11-08 13:38:47] <azaroth> ... another way to have a term with a nested key, that does allow round tripping
[2017-11-08 13:38:51] — cwebber2 @rabbithole
[2017-11-08 13:38:57] <azaroth> gkellogg: Scoped contexts
[2017-11-08 13:39:24] <azaroth> ... Very cool and easy to do.  Define a context within a term definition, so when you see the term, it is as if the context is inserted within the term
[2017-11-08 13:39:48] <azaroth> (everyone): Oh yes. This. This.
[2017-11-08 13:40:12] <azaroth> gkellogg: So the context comes into play for values of the term. Name is Manu at the top level, then an interest which has two keys name and topic
[2017-11-08 13:40:37] <azaroth> ... Now name and topic are evaluated according to foaf not schema
[2017-11-08 13:40:45] — bigbluehat congrats to the scribe azaroth for capturing the room-mood in response to this feature. :)
[2017-11-08 13:40:49] <azaroth> ... gets around the framing problem of putting contexts lower down in the frame
[2017-11-08 13:40:51] — azaroth :D
[2017-11-08 13:41:01] <azaroth> ... these are recursive, so context -> term -> context -> ...
[2017-11-08 13:41:18] <azaroth> ... desire in the community, or at least a misunderstanding, about what contexts are for

[2017-11-08 13:41:29] — Zakim sees bigbluehat on the speaker queue
[2017-11-08 13:41:37] <azaroth> ... thought if you added data to a term definition to the context it would be added to the data. That's not the case

[2017-11-08 13:42:20] <azaroth> bigbluehat: Fixes the confusion that you're defining a term globally, and name now has one meaning through out.  Fixes the problem for "found json" ... others json I want to be -ld

[2017-11-08 13:44:17] <azaroth> gkellogg: Last context wins
[2017-11-08 13:44:45] <betehess>  /me notes that we needed something like in schema.org because of some terms pointing to GoodRelations entities
[2017-11-08 13:44:54] <azaroth> ... scoped context based on type.  Key off of @type to assign the context.
[2017-11-08 13:45:13] <azaroth> ... So the term definition is based on the @type of the resource, not the key that is used to refer to it

[2017-11-08 13:46:32] <azaroth> gkellogg: it requires injecting code at the beginning of expansion where we look at type. Have to look at key for expansion, then also pass the context in.
[2017-11-08 13:46:38] <azaroth> So some insertion but not duplication
[2017-11-08 13:46:45] <azaroth> ... then add code that processes the type
[2017-11-08 13:46:54] <azaroth> ... appends the context to be used. Doesn't require two passes

[2017-11-08 13:50:44] <azaroth> gkellogg: When compacting, it was common to be surprised by keys used. eg:  making a sport key, would produce sport:sEvent, not sportsEvent
