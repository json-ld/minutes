<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Any additions to the agenda?</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  I raised another issue, but we'll discuss along with IANA parameters (ISSUE-214)</div>
<h1 id="topic-1" class="topic">Topic: Remaining Editorial Work for JSON-LD 1.0 Specification</h1>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  I've gone through and done a complete pass over the JSON-LD 1.0 spec.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… I tried to be very thorough about grammar flow, syntax, and so forth.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… As always, we'll need a couple of more people to go over the spec and agree to the changes.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… The major changes we've already discussed last week.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… There are some other minor changes that could impact other things.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… The biggest changes were moving from beginning to advanced sections, to aide flow for people form whom the concepts are new.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  I had some comments.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  In my inbox, haven't gotten to read it yet. We'll discuss them on this call.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: <a href="http://json-ld.org/spec/latest/json-ld-syntax/#data-annotations">http://json-ld.org/spec/latest/json-ld-syntax/#data-annotations</a></div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  data annotations first.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… markus, you put in a use of data annotations that I hadn't thought about, and we should discuss.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… For example 51, we have annotations used like a comment, which is not what I was thinking they were about, but they can certainly be used for that.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… It was primarily intended as a container type, and not a comment. In this case, it looks like it would be lost across expansion.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  the reasoning was to describe it in a simpler way without relying on containers.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… Basically, annotations are data which survive expansion/compaction, etc. It would, though, be lost when going to RDF.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… This is the simplest way to describe the keyword.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… The Annotation Maps (ex 52), is used to show more advanced usage.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Niklas Lindström</span>:  I wonder if the choice of the name of the keyword is unfortunate. Was @key suggested?</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… I'm not sure if this is helpful, because the primary use case was ex 52, and other similar situations when there is a corresponding property on the object itself, such asdc:language, or the text value of the date or author.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… It is primarily for artificial index keys which are necessary to allow the algorithms to work.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  it was @index I had proposed, as I had looked at this as a way to allow indexes to survive.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Niklas Lindström</span>:  perhaps @key is even more appropriate; when you use @container, you can't hav several keys to confuse the mechanism.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… For one object, you cannot have several keys, otherwise the @container annotation would be confused.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… If a term were aliased to @annotation, and then use different terms, also aliased to @annotation, it would confuse the algorithms.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… The keyword @key is more explicit.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  two questions, name of the keyword, and do we want to support bare string annotations.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  not a question of support, just documentation.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  leaning towards not documenting this usage</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… This was not my intent when agreeing to use this mechanism. People could use things other than strings, which is not in the grammar, but people might think it follows.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… now we're describing another usage, as a basic string annotation, but not intended for use with the annotation maps.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… This becomes limiting.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… I'd rather not have this in there, and have them create a new term.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  I'm inclined to agree - this is promoting using JSON-LD markup features when it's more appropriate to use things like rdfs:comment. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  By giving people a feature like this, we're giving people an excuse to not mark it up as Linked Data. Also, perhaps @annotation isn't a good name. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  I'd be fine with removing the example.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… Because the keyword is called annotation, the most natural thing is to use it for annotations. It's still there, but not L.D.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  I'd say we could work on the intro, if needed.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Niklas Lindström</span>: Lin, would you mind if the keyword @annotation (which is used for the extended language map feature) is renamed? Suggested name is @key.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Lin Clark</span>: We haven't implemented that yet, so that's fine</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  Maybe this indicates that the "@annotation" name is bad? [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  we want to show an equivalent of example 51, so people know how it round-trips.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… The section needs a bit more work.</div>
<div class="proposal"><strong>PROPOSAL:</strong> "Remove Example 51: Data annotations" and provide different examples showing how data annotations survive expansion/compaction.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>: +1</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: +1</div>

<div id="resolution-1" class="resolution"><strong>RESOLUTION:</strong> "Remove Example 51: Data annotations" and provide different examples showing how data annotations survive expansion/compaction.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  other ideas: @index, @map.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Niklas Lindström</span>:  it would look strange if looking at the expanded data.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  @index is pretty descriptive of what's going on here. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  It seems to make sense in expanded form and in the context. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Niklas Lindström</span>:  I think of this as the key in the map.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… I like @key in and of itself, but when looked at along other keywords, it looks odd.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  I feel strongly about changing it from annotations to something else. Maybe we can change to @index, and see how people feel about it.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  the problem I have with @index, that looking at an array, all elements are indexed, as in a cardinal location.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>: What about something like @marker</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  I agree that data annotations are going in the wrong direction, it doesn't matter what we change it to as long as it's in a better direction. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  "index into an object" works for most... I'd go w/ either @index or @key... @key is probably the most accurate, but @key next to @id and @type makes it not clear what it's used for. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Gregg just convinced me that @index is probably the best.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Niklas Lindström</span>:  from the thesaurus, it looks like a reasonable choice.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  also, this is editorial, it doesn't really effect the semantics.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  why change, to prevent the use case or not promote it.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  to be clearer about what the feature does.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Niklas Lindström</span>: <a href="http://thesaurus.com/browse/index:">http://thesaurus.com/browse/index:</a> "Definition: indication … Synonyms: clue, mark, symbol, token...</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  The keys in a database don't really have semantic meaning, and aren't typically exposed to the application layer.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… This is effectively a database, and we are creating an index. The feature is easily comparable to a database index; not really an annotation mechanism.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… My understanding was that developers needed to access the data quickly, which is the definition of what a database index is used for.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… I think it's more accurate to say it's like a database index than an annotation.</div>
<div class="proposal"><strong>PROPOSAL:</strong> Rename @annotation to @index and update the prose in section 6.14 to reflect the change.</div>

<div class="comment"><span class="name">Lin Clark</span>: Thanks for the heads up :)</div>
<h1 id="topic-2" class="topic">Topic: Update to JSON-LD Data Model</h1>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  I was a bit concerned about these changes.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>: <a href="https://github.com/json-ld/json-ld.org/commit/cc034077d5177f85fdccc69a5ac8062e66368e93">https://github.com/json-ld/json-ld.org/commit/cc034077d5177f85fdccc69a5ac8062e66368e93</a></div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  I modified what a node was in the JSON-LD data model, and Markus and I disagreed.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… This comes out of something Richard Cyganiak said...</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… "Every node represents a resource or a value. Resources are labeled by a bnode or an IRI". Before it said that every node _is_ and IRI, etc.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  Richard said they're not labeled, but they are IRIs.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Niklas Lindström</span>: <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#data-model">http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#data-model</a></div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Niklas Lindström</span>:  the data model is just the abstract syntax, and looking at RDF 1.1 Concepts...</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… (quoting from data-model).</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… What might have through it up was that arcs were IRIs too, but in fact arcs are labeled, not nodes.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  As I recall, there were some strong feelings about the node is an IRI. I agree with Niklas and Markus. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… We've sometimes conflated the JSON object with the node, and the resource the node represents.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  we should change it back then, but I'll check with cygri.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Niklas Lindström</span>:  we need to check our usage of node, but I think we're okay.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… Just verify we don't use "node" and "resource" indistinguishably.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Niklas Lindström</span>: .. possible problems: <a href="http://json-ld.org/spec/latest/json-ld-syntax/#node-identifiers">http://json-ld.org/spec/latest/json-ld-syntax/#node-identifiers</a> and http://json-ld.org/spec/latest/json-ld-syntax/#grammar-node-object</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  it MUST be either an IRI or BNode.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  In RDF Concepts, it MUST be an IRI. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  but that's where we deviate from it. In SPARQL, it's an existential variable. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Niklas Lindström</span>:  There is a difference between an existential variable and a bnode. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  Not really, a bnode is a non-distinguished variable. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  For JSON-LD - we are implicitly allowing bnodes to be used as graph labels. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  the concern I had was that each named graph is a pair, but since an IRI and BNode are nodes, it because something more like a "node class" mapped to a graph.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  From Concepts: "Each named graph is a pair consisting of an IRI (the graph name), and an RDF graph"</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Niklas Lindström</span>:  I talked with someone who thanked us for supporting BNode graph names.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  for the spec, change "BNode" to "BNode identifier"</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  I'm worried about being inconsistent with the definition of node.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  but this is a string to graph mapping. It is a pair of name (string) to graph. A node is not a string, but a bnode identifier is.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  there's an issue of scopes then. The identifier is scoped to the document.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Niklas Lindström</span>:  in RDF, you can't have graphs within graphs, and BNodes only exist within a graph.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  We're making use of BNOde identified graph, and need this in JSON-LD.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… It's based on timestampping elements and using them to identify graphs, rather than pretending we're creating an IRI of the graph.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Niklas Lindström</span>: .. urn:uuid:....</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  we could use a hash identifier, but we tend to shy away from using new URNs when we can use a BNode.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  we don't like UUIDs, because they look like garbage.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Niklas Lindström</span>:  I find BNodes useful, but BNode ids not so much.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… I only use BNodes for compound values, and occasionally, when I _really_ don't know the ID.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  if we add them in here, we push the conversation forward.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  we did discuss the differences already.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Niklas Lindström</span>:  if there's a good theoretical issue, it would be good to have in an explicit document.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  so ask what the theoretical reason to not use BNode identifiers for graph names.</div>
<div id="action-1" class="action">ACTION: Write e-mail to RDF WG asking why blank node identifiers can't be used for graph names and predicates.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  the last change is terminology about saying a node is either a resource or a value.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  I think we should remove "resource", as it confuses things.</div>
<h1 id="topic-3" class="topic">Topic: Context via HTTP Link Header</h1>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Let's quickly bike-shed the name of this section.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>: Transforming JSON to JSON-LD</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>: Referencing contexts from JSON documents</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  I think many people have JSON and would like to transform to JSON-LD if it doesn't require large changes.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  I really like Transforming JSON to JSON-LD [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Niklas Lindström</span>:  is "transforming" the right idea?</div>
<div class="information">The group decides that "Interpreting JSON as JSON-LD" strikes the right balance.</div>
<h1 id="topic-4" class="topic">Topic: IANA parameters</h1>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: <a href="http://json-ld.org/spec/latest/json-ld-syntax/#iana-considerations">http://json-ld.org/spec/latest/json-ld-syntax/#iana-considerations</a></div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  The major issues were the optional parameters. We had "form" and "profile"</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… We used to have compact, but it was non-deterministic. Now it is deterministic.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… I think "form" needs to have values of "expanded" and "compacted".</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  we didn't have it, as it didn't really mean anything.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… This is related to the issue I raised. Do we really need to parameter, or can we embed within the document.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Niklas Lindström</span>:  or for content negotiation.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  you can do the same with profile, buy just minting a new IRI.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Niklas Lindström</span>:  should we then mint some IRIs for the forms we've mentioned?</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  The purpose for 'form' is so that people can know the format of the document w/o processing it. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>: We minted <a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context">http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context</a> to reference a context</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Niklas Lindström</span>: .. e.g. profile=<a href="http://json-ld.org/profile/expanded+flattened">http://json-ld.org/profile/expanded+flattened</a> ...</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  proposal to get rid of form and encode within profile.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… But, I think the prose around profile is confusing. I thought it was in case we had a schema which restricted the data.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  the profile uses an identifier to describe some constraints or conventions used within the document, and mark the document with those conventions.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  what about a link to a JSON schema?</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  the consumer must understand what the IRI means, so if the consumer knows about schemas, it could use it.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Niklas Lindström</span>:  I'm mostly thinking about content negotiation scenarios.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  So get rid of form? Then we'd need the following two IRIs: <a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#expanded">http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#expanded</a> http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#expanded-flattened ? [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  you could specify in profile that you wanted a specific vocabulary.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Niklas Lindström</span>:  shouldn't the IRI be opaque?</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… You need to link to it or have it in another link header.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… I wonder if it's good to define form to use the tokens "expand, compact", with or without "flattened".</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… Gives four variations.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: okay, proposals then - <a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#expanded">http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#expanded</a> http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#compacted http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#expanded-flattened http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#expanded-compacted</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  those four, with either using "-" or "+" as separators.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Niklas Lindström</span>:  they might not need to be IRIs.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  using IRIs allows other people to add their own profiles. Otherwise, we'd need a registry.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… The profile mechanism allows anyone to define their own.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… If they want to add a JSON schema, they can mint a new IRI for every one they expose.</div>

<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Dave Longley been working on his implementation, which is now complete. He is currently combining the text that Markus and Gregg wrote and expanding on the problem and general solution statements for each algorithm. Some of the algorithms are being re-written, but in a way that flows better and in a way that matches his implementation. So, once he's done, we should have a good middle-ground between what Markus and Gregg had, better prose outlining the algorithms, and some simpler algorithms. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>

<div class="comment"><span class="name">Niklas Lindström</span>:  my friend had a problem with this wording.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… If I understand him, he wasn't sure it was enough to add @id; he wanted to make sure he had a named graph.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  The text is wrong, but let's try to fix it now. I'll make a change right after the call.</div>
