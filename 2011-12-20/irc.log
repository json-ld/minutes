[11:03]	<manu1>	Topic: ISSUE-43: Use of IRIs and CURIEs as @context keys
[11:04]	<manu1>	https://github.com/json-ld/json-ld.org/issues/43
[11:05]	<manu1>	PROPOSAL: Allow IRI expansion to operate in @context for prefixes on the left-hand side of prefix declarations. The IRI expansion mechanism SHOULD be recursive, in that it continues to execute as long as one prefix/term is expanded in the current cycle. If a cycle is detected during resolution, then an exception MUST be thrown.
