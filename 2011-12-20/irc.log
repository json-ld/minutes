[10:06]	<taaz>	manu1: Dave Longley updated all the implementations based on recent decisions. playground updated.
[10:06]	<taaz>	manu1: has context modifications for @id, @type, coerce rules

[10:07]	<taaz>	manu1: dave said due to less keywords need to do more work to figure out what you are dealing with. but it worked out.

[10:12]	<lanthaler>	https://github.com/json-ld/json-ld.org/issues/45
[10:13]	<taaz>	lanthaler: issue is various keywords (type, id, etc) as case sensitive or not. feedback on mailing list was for case sensitive. everyone seems to agree now.

[10:15]	<taaz>	lanthaler: http has header parms for link headers and mime type params. could use this for data or context documents.

[10:17]	<taaz>	manu1: more comfortable with link header than changing mime type with content type
[10:18]	<taaz>	manu1: not sure if content type is required. may want to make that a SHOULD vs MUST to deal with client handling issue.

[10:18]	<voip-ld>	Added niklasl to the speaker queue: niklasl
[10:19]	<taaz>	manu1: where should this processing happen? should it be at application layer? application can look at header and perform context retrieval and insertion into document.

[11:03]	<manu1>	Topic: ISSUE-43: Use of IRIs and CURIEs as @context keys
[11:04]	<manu1>	https://github.com/json-ld/json-ld.org/issues/43
[11:05]	<manu1>	PROPOSAL: Allow IRI expansion to operate in @context for prefixes on the left-hand side of prefix declarations. The IRI expansion mechanism SHOULD be recursive, in that it continues to execute as long as one prefix/term is expanded in the current cycle. If a cycle is detected during resolution, then an exception MUST be thrown.
