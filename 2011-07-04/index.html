  <div class="comment">
    <span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: Does anyone have objections to
    swapping agenda items #3 and #1. So we would do introductions first, then
    talk about the current state of the spec and implementations, and then go
    into attempting to define Linked Data more formally?

  <div class="comment">
    <span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: involved in rdfa standardization,
    PaySwarm, which was the reason for creating json-ld
  </div>

  <div class="comment">
    <span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: JSON-LD was influenced by Mark
    Birbeck's RDFj and Ian Davis of Talis' RDF/JSON work.
  </div>

  <div class="comment">
    <span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>: consultant, working in media area
    (music, video, etc), responsible for most of the RDF parsers in Ruby
  </div>

  <div class="comment">
    <span class="name">Bradley Allen</span>: working on extending APIs for
    giving our developers access to metadata, our company is one of the largest
    publishers of scientific data in the world.
  </div>

  <div class="comment">
    <span class="name">Bradley Allen</span>: started from XML underpinning,
    moving more &amp; more to json
  </div>

  <div class="comment">
    <span class="name">Thomas Steiner</span>: Coming from REST corner, went to
    Semantic Web/Linked data corner - developing RDFa browser extensions.
  </div>

  <div class="comment">
    <span class="name">Thomas Steiner</span>: Thought it would be great if we
    could not only get metadata out of the pages, but also publish data in JSON
    in a more Webby way
  </div>

  <div class="comment">
    <span class="name">Thomas Steiner</span>: Also in the RDF and RDFa Working
    Groups at W3C. I feel there is a need for serialization... I feel unsure
    exactly what I want out of this - full glory of JSON, full glory of RDF,
    something in the middle. Should be something that supports triples at the
    least.
  </div>

  <div class="comment">
    <span class="name">Michael Johnson</span>: I work at Digital Bazaar on the
    PaySwarm stuff and the Universal Payment standard initiative

  <h1 id="topic-2"
      class="topic">Topic: State of the Specs and Implementations</h1>

  <div class="comment">
    <span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: there are two specs for JSON-LD
    right now, advanced and basic
  </div>

  <div class="comment">
    <span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: do we want this separation at all?
    That's actively being discussed in the community.
  </div>

  <div class="comment">
    <span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: most complete implementation is the
    one Dave Longley is working on, could you take us through that, Dave?

  <div class="comment">
    <span class="name">Dave Longley</span>: worked on the JavaScript
    implementation, which is pretty complete.

  <div class="comment">
    <span class="name">Dave Longley</span>: and the c++ implementation
  </div>

  <div class="comment">
    <span class="name">Dave Longley</span>: implementations include expanding
    objects (CURIE expansion)
  </div>

  <div class="comment">
    <span class="name">Dave Longley</span>: implementation included compacting
    (CURIE compaction and remapping)
  </div>

  <div class="comment">
    <span class="name">Dave Longley</span>: implemantion also includes
    normalization &amp; framing
  </div>

  <div class="comment">
    <span class="name">Dave Longley</span>: corner cases difficult to implement
  </div>

  <div class="comment">
    <span class="name">Dave Longley</span>: framing feature not yet spec'ed,
    but used internally to build simple representations of graphs - think
    simple JSON objects. Kind of like Projections in RDFa. Developers just want
    to work with simple objects directly, not necessarily graph APIs.
  </div>

  <div class="comment">
    <span class="name">Dave Longley</span>: frame acts as a filter to the graph
    dataset - just give me what I want to work with. Just give me events, or
    people, etc.
  </div>

  <div class="comment">
    <span class="name">Dave Longley</span>: We have a set of tests for

  <div class="comment">
    <span class="name">Dave Longley</span>: that's it for JavaScript, C++ has
    the same set of features - it's just a port of the JavaScript code.
  </div>

  <div class="comment">
    <span class="name">Dave Longley</span>: A python port in the works, Mike's
    working on that.
  </div>

  <div class="comment">
    <span class="name">Michael Johnson</span>: I took the JavaScript code and
    was able to port it over pretty quickly. It took 3 days and the Python
    version passes all of the tests, except for the evil normalization test.
  </div>

    <span class="name">Dave Longley</span>: :)

  </div>

  <div class="comment">
    <span class="name">Michael Johnson</span>: we need to update the public
    implementation, but we'll release the code when we upgrade the PaySwarm
    Authority reference implementation. The Python JSON-LD code will eventually
    get it's own repository. I've also been writing a unit test framework for
    the python implmentaiton
  </div>

  <div class="comment">
    <span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>: I have a complete parser working,
    the serializer is working except for the normalization stuff.

  <div class="comment">
    <span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: ballen: Right now I haven't updated
    my JSON-LD implementation to the latest spec - I've taken elements of the
    spec and applied it to specific purposes for Linked Data.
  </div>

  <div class="comment">
    <span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: ballen: Using the idiom itself to do
    encoding - using that w/ MongoDB to be able to build a low complexity query
    RDF store in that framework.
  </div>

  <div class="comment">
    <span class="name">Bradley Allen</span>: using it together with mongo db to
    build an RDF store
  </div>

  <div class="information">
    some more JSON-LD implementations can be found by googling
  </div>

  <div class="comment">
    <span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: Henri Bergius has a JSON-LD
    implementation for VIE - part of the IKS semantic wiki project in the EU.
  </div>

  <div class="comment">
    <span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: spec is fairly up-to-date as far as
    the syntaxes are concerned, barring any major changes to the data model.
  </div>

  <div class="comment">
    <span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: two things going on in parallel
  </div>

  <div class="comment">
    <span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: We believe that normalization for
    the non-ridiculous cases can be dealt with easily, the ridiculous cases are
    NP, but Dave is working on solutions for those.

      class="topic">Topic: Formal Definition of Linked Data</h1>

  <div class="comment">
    <span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: There are a group of people saying
  </div>

  <div class="comment">
    <span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: some folks are saying that RDF is
    too complex, we need to simplify the linked json stuff

  <div class="comment">
    <span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: gregg has put a doc together

  </div>

  <div class="comment">
    <span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: let's go thru Gregg's doc and do a
    straw poll to see if we have consensus on some of the items.
  </div>

  <div class="comment">
    <span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>: seemed like email convos were
    going round in circles
  </div>

  <div class="comment">
    <span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>: thought might make sense to
    structure the discussion
  </div>

  <div class="comment">
    <span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>: what is linked data? We should get
    a good formal definition before we go too far.
  </div>

  <div class="comment">
    <span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>: bnodes made it seem too close to
    RDF
  </div>

  <div class="comment">
    <span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>: thought we could talk about it in
    the form of graphs
  </div>

  <div class="comment">
    <span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>: if we know what linked data means,
    what does it imply for JSON?
  </div>

  <div class="comment">
    <span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>: what is the model we're looking
    at?
  </div>

  <div class="comment">
    <span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>: is it a graph? or is it a
    json-centric model? or is it something else?
  </div>

  <div class="comment">
    <span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>: "What is Linked Data?" seems to be
    the crux of the confusion on the mailing list.

  <div class="comment">
    <span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: let's go thru each item
  </div>

  <div class="comment">
    <span class="name">Michael Johnson</span>: +1
  </div>

  <div class="comment">
    <span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: Linked Data is used to express
    relationships between entities expressed as subject-predicate-object, or
    entity-attribute-value.
  </div>

  <div class="comment">
    <span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: (was suggesting to go thru points
    one by one)

    <span class="name">Dave Longley</span>: not everything has to expressed as
    a set of triples

    <span class="name">Dave Longley</span>: that was gkellogg
  </div>

  <div class="comment">
    <span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>: linked data used to represent
    directed graphs
  </div>

  <div class="comment">
    <span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>: destination nodes can be called
    subject/object, vertexes predicates
  </div>

  <div class="comment">
    <span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: Linked Data is used to represent a
    directed graph, and within the context of Linked Data, the graph can be
    represented as connections between different nodes, nodes are subjects and
    objects, links are properties. Nodes may have identifiers that are URIs
    allowing them to be externally addressed.
  </div>

  <div class="comment">
    <span class="name">Bradley Allen</span>: would be clarifying if we scrub
    the rdf roots
  </div>

  <div class="comment">
    <span class="name">Bradley Allen</span>: need to be crisp about the
    terminology
  </div>

  <div class="comment">
    <span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: what you find over time is the need
    to use words that define concepts, (over)loaded with decades of usage
  </div>

  <div class="comment">
    <span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: an example would be blank nodes
  </div>

  <div class="comment">
    <span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: { "name": "Bradley Allen" }
  </div>

  <div class="comment">
    <span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: immedeate thing you get out of that
    example is the requirement for something like a blank node. That JSON
    object doesn't have an identifier, there is an doiscussion going on if we
    need identifiers all the time
  </div>

  <div class="comment">
    <span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: we've been through this
    simplification game before
  </div>

  <div class="comment">
    <span class="name">Thomas Steiner</span>: linked data is imho the concept
    of providing links where no links used to exist before
  </div>

  <div class="comment">
    <span class="name">Thomas Steiner</span>: quoting http
  </div>

  <div class="comment">
    <span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: not sure if we can create a spec on
    top of that - the definition is too loose.
  </div>

  <div class="comment">
    <span class="name">Dave Longley</span>: they seem to end up being the same
    definitions
  </div>

  <div class="comment">
    <span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: let's strawpoll with what Gregg
    said.
  </div>

  <div class="comment">
    <span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: Linked Data is used to represent a

  <div class="comment">

    <span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>: this is where we start to confuse

  <div class="comment">
    <span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>: json-ld must provide a way to do
    this, but that's why we have context - it's higher up the stack.
  </div>

  <div class="comment">
    <span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>: we didn't make this statement for
    subjects, as oftentimes there are no proper IRIs defined for subjects
  </div>

  <div class="comment">
    <span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>: a property relationship is a best
    practice
  </div>

  <div class="comment">
    <span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: A property SHOULD be labeled with an
    IRI almost always, there are very few use cases that make sense where you
    don't label a property with an IRI. There are more use cases where you
    don't label a node with an IRI.
  </div>

  <div class="comment">
    <span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>: that's the motivation behind
    SHOULD for property vs. MAY for subject

  <div class="comment">
    <span class="name">Bradley Allen</span>: what you can say, though, is that

  <div class="comment">
    <span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>: if an object is a scalar value

  <div class="comment">
    <span class="name">Bradley Allen</span>: for a given json object you could
    draw the graph in a serialization-neutral way
