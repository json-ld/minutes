<div class="comment-continuation">... How much overlap is there between Beaker&apos;s goals and other goals? Maybe more colab makes sense.</div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-3').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-3').show()" id="3" class="comment"><span class="name">Paul Frazze</span>:  Our focus starts with publishing, allowing people to publish without using a 3rd party service. <a id="link-3" style="display:none;" href="#3">✪</a></div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... From there, it&apos;s possible to create applications. The stack will grow over time, at the moment we&apos;re seeing how much we can get out of a DAT network.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... through that, you can build a class of applicaitons, such as social networking and office software. This has led to a couple of things, one which is like Twitter, but another deviates in UI.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... It&apos;s primarily a filesystem shared over the network, and activly watch the files for change. They can be any data you like, but we chose JSON.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... You follow each other by scanning JSON files for changes and then index to use as content.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... Eventually, we run into schema coordination issues. That&apos;s how we got to the JSON-LD conversation.</div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-9').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-9').show()" id="9" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  I want to make sure we get to Paul&apos;s concerns. <a id="link-9" style="display:none;" href="#9">✪</a></div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... I did a readthrough of your README and design document (issue 820) and I believe I understand the problem space and your concernts.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... All of your design goals have a lot of overlap with JSON-LD. When we were putting the spec together we addressed many of the same problems. For about 20% I could see your concerns about JSON-LD, but for everything else, there&apos;s direct applicability.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... Perhaps there are some ways it&apos;s used that aren&apos;t obvious.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... The community tries to not push the spec too hard, but if it&apos;s not useful, we will try hard to address needs. But, at some point, it may be too different to adapt to goals.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... There is quite a bit of community input, so it does more than any one individual wants, but it addressed the needs of an important community.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... A lot of 1.1 work is based on community feedback.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... JSON-LD is used from between 10% to 19% of all domains on the internet (most probably for SEO).</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... The other class of people using it tend to be data scientists and government open data. In these cases, getting the semantics right is crucial.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... In the worst case, you can at least learn from some of our experience.</div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-10').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-10').show()" id="10" class="comment"><span class="name">Paul Frazze</span>:  I have a lot of respect for the time and effort put into JSON-LD. <a id="link-10" style="display:none;" href="#10">✪</a></div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... With this project, I talked with people to get opinions. People may have used RDF and really understood the value. Other people didn&apos;t see the utility and very much did not like it. So, there&apos;s an emotional reaction. I&apos;m trying to understand real problems from perception.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... The requirements are somewhat unique; in the service of making publishing easy, we&apos;re also looking to make application development very easy and allow programming by view-source.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... Ease of use and understaning for programmers of all skill levels; we want people to have fun.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... We need to make sure we have the extensibility use case in mind always.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... The expectation is that everyone may have their own client; everyone may  have their own datamodel. We may be refering to schemas always.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... Our observations are summarized in JSON-LZ (LaZy), which led to this call.</div>
<div class="error">Error: (IRC nickname &apos;cadorn&apos; not recognized)[2018-02-07T20:21:35.961Z]&#9;&lt;cadorn&gt;&#9;looks like my client is not working; will listen to recording; thanks!</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... We wanted to make sure the meta-data information did not need to be pre-meditated. People are probably not going to invest consistently and reliably, and may change things later.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... In that vein, I&apos;m concerned about the need for up-front tooling. If we minimize the amount of tooling needed, that would be good, but it may be &#226;&#8364;&#339;painted on&#226;&#8364;&#157; later.</div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-11').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-11').show()" id="11" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  What struck me is that it&apos;s the same design space. I can understand why someone using JSON-LD might think there needs to be a lot of up-front work, but that&apos;s not quite true. <a id="link-11" style="display:none;" href="#11">✪</a></div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... When we designed, we had JSON programmers in mind, and don&apos;t want to for people down the -LD route.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... E.g., if you look at the activity pub spec, you don&apos;t really need to have a defined vocabulary to use it.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... We couldn&apos;t do that in the base-JSON-LD spec, but it&apos;s something that other groups have done.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... So, for all data published by something like Beaker, you might assume a particular context. That might just define a namespace that things go to if not otherwise defined.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... This makes you compatibile with LD elsewhere. That allows you to be lazy in your approach.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... We have some non-profits and for-profits using JSON-LD. Usually when developing, the schema is the last thing we do. We&apos;re Mongo-DB based and we just start doing JSON datastructures. It&apos;s only at the end that we start locking things down.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... As we figure out the scope, we start to get more formal.</div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-12').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-12').show()" id="12" class="comment"><span class="name">Paul Frazze</span>:  One thing I get a reaction from from people that don&apos;t come from RDF/LD is they don&apos;t understand the value proposition. A way to short-circuit that might be to use a mechanism similar to the Link header to specify the context to allow it to be painted on externally. <a id="link-12" style="display:none;" href="#12">✪</a></div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... This could allow metadata without syntax. and allows complicated information to be separated and documents to avoid boilerplate.</div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-13').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-13').show()" id="13" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  In the beginning, we got feedback about squatting on different names, which is where the &#226;&#8364;&#339;@&#226;&#8364;&#339; syntax came from, but people say that don&apos;t like that. <a id="link-13" style="display:none;" href="#13">✪</a></div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... We address that through keyword aliases to, for example, alias &#226;&#8364;&#339;@id&#226;&#8364;&#157; to &#226;&#8364;&#339;id&#226;&#8364;&#157;. Just not for @context.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... But the Link header addresses that.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... Or, it can be specified as part of the specification.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... The other thing is that people don&apos;t like namespaces. It&apos;s debatable, but people don&apos;t want to see compact IRIs. JSON-LD allows prefixing, but doesn&apos;t require it. RDF folks get the namespacing, but others can completely avoid it by sticking to terms.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... Things with &#226;&#8364;&#339;.&#226;&#8364;&#157; or &#226;&#8364;&#339;:&#226;&#8364;&#157; in the names are problematic, but the context allows you to get around these.</div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-14').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-14').show()" id="14" class="comment"><span class="name">Paul Frazze</span>:  The aliasing is quite close to what we need. You can individuallly alias terms to namespaces, but to do it at a broad stroke requires prefixing. Otherwise, you need to define each term. <a id="link-14" style="display:none;" href="#14">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-15').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-15').show()" id="15" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  @Vocab allows that. <a id="link-15" style="display:none;" href="#15">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-16').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-16').show()" id="16" class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  THere is a change in 1.1, that allows scoped contexts... allows data from diferent locations. In one place you might have something like &quot;identifier&quot; that means something particlar, but now you go into some other property... you can previously solve via inline context, but now you can do w/ scoped context. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny] <a id="link-16" style="display:none;" href="#16">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-17').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-17').show()" id="17" class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  You can set @vocab to schema.org, or you can do @vocab to foaf... that&apos;s something that&apos;s a way to use the vocabulary mechanism, but have it logically resolve to different namespaces w/o having data users deal w/ it. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny] <a id="link-17" style="display:none;" href="#17">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-18').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-18').show()" id="18" class="information"><a href="https://json-ld.org/spec/latest/json-ld/#scoped-contexts">https://json-ld.org/spec/latest/json-ld/#scoped-contexts</a> <a id="link-18" style="display:none;" href="#18">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-19').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-19').show()" id="19" class="comment"><span class="name">Paul Frazze</span>:  The solution I was looking at is a globbing pattern, it has the advantage of painting over multiple different attributes w/o having different applications. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny] <a id="link-19" style="display:none;" href="#19">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-20').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-20').show()" id="20" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  That came up when working on JSON-LD vocab stuff. the danger was people stomping over too much data. Regexps are hard. <a id="link-20" style="display:none;" href="#20">✪</a></div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... Because the focus was on getting the semantics right, we chose to not go there. As a consequence, contexts can get large.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... But in practice, the amount you need tends to be pretty small. For example, look at Activity Pub, they just define a handfull of terms.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... Schema.org, on the otherhand, defines many terms, as there&apos;s a single flat namespace.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... I understand the desire to use globbing to reduce the size of the context, but in practice, it tends not to be a problem.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... If we brought up globbing patterns in 1.1, we&apos;d probably hit the same problems. Why not just write the context once without using globbing.</div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-21').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-21').show()" id="21" class="comment"><span class="name">Paul Frazze</span>:  I understand your argument, but if it were possible, engineers would appriciate it. <a id="link-21" style="display:none;" href="#21">✪</a></div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... I wouldn&apos;t make it a blocker, but please keep it in your mind.</div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-22').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-22').show()" id="22" class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  The way the group thinks about it is by managing issues and through community engagement. I&apos;d encourage you to file an issue and start a dialogue. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny] <a id="link-22" style="display:none;" href="#22">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-23').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-23').show()" id="23" class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  I share Manu&apos;s concern around potential complexity around globbing. From a standards perspective, you get into what the regex syntax is, whose regex lib are you going to use. Avoiding that as a practical perspective is useful. Prefixes directly address that issue, but they may not be paletable. Maybe there is a middle ground here. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny] <a id="link-23" style="display:none;" href="#23">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-24').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-24').show()" id="24" class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  I think the group has been quite open to trying to address these problems over time.

[scribe assist by Manu Sporny] <a id="link-27" style="display:none;" href="#27">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-28').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-28').show()" id="28" class="comment"><span class="name">Paul Frazze</span>:  I&apos;d like to look for a subset of tools that I could bundle together from the community. We could look at prefixes later. <a id="link-28" style="display:none;" href="#28">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-29').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-29').show()" id="29" class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  Yes, that&apos;s what a lot of other groups do... limit JSON-LD to particular dialect. Work on publishing CSV as Linked Data, uses a descriptor format as JSON-LD, but to get to some of the extensibility bits, you can add arbitrary JSON-LD in various locations, but stick to dialect. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny] <a id="link-29" style="display:none;" href="#29">✪</a></div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... That can reduce the load on developers</div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-30').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-30').show()" id="30" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  There have been people that use JSON-LD as a back-end language and work through a library. Actual publication happens out of a library. <a id="link-30" style="display:none;" href="#30">✪</a></div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... or, reverse domain notation, instead of colons.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... You can always handle these in a library and output JSON-LD in the backend.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... As a result, you can transform between different dialects.</div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-31').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-31').show()" id="31" class="comment"><span class="name">Paul Frazze</span>:  Should vocabularies use URL identifiers? I imagine it&apos;s been discussed before. <a id="link-31" style="display:none;" href="#31">✪</a></div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... I want people to be free to make extensions to schemas, which may imply that they need to set up documents to maintain for very common tasks.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... dispite the advantages of URIs, there&apos;s something to be said for simply long strings.</div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-32').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-32').show()" id="32" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  When we started, we though we might hard-code some common schemas, but we ultimately came to URLs as publishing is easy, but may still be too high a barrior. <a id="link-32" style="display:none;" href="#32">✪</a></div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... URLs don&apos;t have to be HTTP, they could be dat, or otherthings.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... Make up names and start using, then publish later.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... in JSON-LD processors, you can overload how documents are found, so a small shim can allow you to specify a new way of looking up things. This give you a kind of schema mechanism.</div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-33').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-33').show()" id="33" class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  You can use URNs today... you can even use bnodes... fundamentally it&apos;s an IRI. You don&apos;t need to be able to resolve/download. JSON-LD is an enabling technology for that, not an enforcing technology. DAT is just fine. URN is just fine Anything you want to use for that purpose. It might actually be something that is potentially dereferenceable. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny] <a id="link-33" style="display:none;" href="#33">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-34').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-34').show()" id="34" class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  You may start off w/ something that&apos;s dereferenceable, describe a vocabulary, describe metadata on it.

<div onmouseout="$('#link-36').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-36').show()" id="36" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Then, you wouldn&apos;t know how to dereference in the future. <a id="link-36" style="display:none;" href="#36">✪</a></div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-37').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-37').show()" id="37" class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  THere have been some other things that have been talked about... document-relative properties... it&apos;s kind of a hard core RDF issue. Got a document that describe itself, why can&apos;t properties used in there relative to the document? Something we might add into 1.1 - fragment identifier that is looked up in the document.

<div onmouseout="$('#link-38').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-38').show()" id="38" class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  Another thing - property that is a URI that is not a property... nothing restricts you from doing that. Once you make use of JSON-LD algorithms, compact/expand/turn into RDF - URI pattern, in danger of being lost.

RDF allows you to make two properties similar... cool semantics that can be relied on when you get to reasoning. But that&apos;s a bit cart before the horse. First step is get people to publish what they mean. THey should use well known identifiers. If there are things that are document specific, use document stuff.

We&apos;re saying, let&apos;s try to figure out a way so they don&apos;t have to do that. Perhaps a global context that things fall into while you&apos;re playing around. Only when you need interoperability do you cross that bridge. <a id="link-43" style="display:none;" href="#43">✪</a></div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... The only people that really end up publishing contexts and vocabularies are people that understand the semantics and data modeling. I don&apos;t think it would be good to count on your community to do that.</div>

What they have in common is JSON-LD and Linked Data. We&apos;re trying to do it in a non-invasive way. <a id="link-47" style="display:none;" href="#47">✪</a></div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... I understand the knee-jerk reaction to RDF/Linked Data, and it&apos;s hard to get across to developers that haven&apos;t been involved in it. THe problem is, the more decentralized you get, the less assurance you have in the data that&apos;s consumed.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... We&apos;ve been hitting the limits of JSON, either you need to create specific APIs for everything, or you you go to data interoperability and use common tooling; otherwise, we&apos;re always needing to create a specific solution for each problem, which doesn&apos;t scale.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... We&apos;re trying to make data-publishing easier.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... JSON is the dataformate people use now, but 10 years ago it was XML, now people are using CBOR. The benefit of JSON-LD is that you can transform between different syntaxes.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... When you express data, you can sign it independent of the actual serialization format. This creates forward extensibility.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... The downside is that it&apos;s a bit more complicated. JSON-LD tries to hide this complexity.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... We&apos;re moving to genric signing libraries.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... We&apos;re all in this for the same thing, to give people more power.</div>
