<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  markus went through the algorithms and did a very thorough review</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... most of the comments weren't fundamental issue</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-linked-json/2013Feb/0027.html">http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-linked-json/2013Feb/0027.html</a></div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... the are a couple of comments that popped out as potential issues</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  I haven't been able to look at the changes that Dave Longley has made based on my comments. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  Dave's algorithms are more or less the same than I had in index.html, but overall, they're more or less the same. He uses an inverse context, looks like the one I wrote. Expansion looks fundamentally the same. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  Algorithms were moved around a bit, one algorithm got split (term definition / creation) from context processing, which I'm not sure if it makes sense. Gregg seemed to like it, so I'm fine w/ it. Personal preference, don't like jumping between algorithms. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  I found a few bugs w/ the algorithms, Dave has already fixed some of them. All of the bugs had to do w/ property generators and how they are processed. I think Dave tried to optimize some of the algorithms, but the optimizations didn't bring any advantage, they complicated the description, some bugs were introduced. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  So, some issues with property generator algorithms - if we want to keep the re-organization, then we need to decide. The algorithms are split out, moved around. It would make sense to keep things in that the same as before, would be my preference. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  Expansion is okay. Compaction, we might want to have a closer look. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  Flattening, node generation not changed so far... so good. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Do you have a preference on which algorithms we should use? [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  For expansion - we should pick Dave's. For compaction, we should pick mine. We need error code language, that's missing from Dave's spec, we have to agree on some language. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  I'm not entirely happy with splitting out the remote context processing</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  I've started to go through and do some implementation. My comments are mostly focused on the evaluation context at this point. I found the eval context processing pretty logical. Not entirely comfortable with splitting out remote context processing since Ruby is not an asynchronous implementation. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... I would prefer to process it inline</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... I think it was a premature optimization</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... I prefer to keep context processing, IRI expansion/compaction etc. closely together</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... there was a small comment that in some cases when you expand relative IRIs it might be in a remote context</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... markus had a comment doing the shorter bits at the top of the algorithm instead of at the very end where it might get lost</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... compaction: I found it easier to following the description dave was using for processing the inverse context</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  do you have a preference which spec text to take</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  my version was a try to do minimal changes.. I don't think that's going to happen.. the preference goes to using an inv. context</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... I have to note that I have something similar than a inverse context</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... but typically being too specific inhibits implementers creating differing implementations</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... especially the naming of bnodes in the test suite might be problematic if you do things in different order (parallel)</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  markus haven't seem my updates yet but I fixed most of the problems already</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... so prop. generator stuff works now</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... another problem was inheriting term definitions. I think what my new algorithm does is probably wrong</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... markus had a test case choosing a term with a null-language</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... question is whether choose the term with null-language or no language at all</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... for numbers</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... I think we need a quick discussion what should really happen</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  If it was a string I think you would want the null-language term</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... I would go for the easier algorithm</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Niklas Lindström</span>: .. I consider 12.3 to be (syntactically) equivalent to {"@type": "xsd:double", "@value": "12.3"}</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  we use strings to represent very small numbers</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... we don't want to have them to be language-tagged using the default language</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>: <a href="https://github.com/json-ld/json-ld.org/blob/main/test-suite/tests/compact-0048-in.jsonld">https://github.com/json-ld/json-ld.org/blob/main/test-suite/tests/compact-0048-in.jsonld</a></div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>: <a href="https://github.com/json-ld/json-ld.org/blob/main/test-suite/tests/compact-0048-out.jsonld">https://github.com/json-ld/json-ld.org/blob/main/test-suite/tests/compact-0048-out.jsonld</a></div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... question is, should propertyNoLang or propertyLanguageNull be choosen?</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  quick question, if propertyLanguageNull wouldn't be there you would keep the complete IRI</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  yes</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Niklas Lindström</span>:  I think I would choose propertyLanguageNull because it's most specific, then fall back to propertyNoLang</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  I would be fine with that</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  yeah</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  ok, lets do that</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  markus and gregg said we should highlight the removal of the context in expansion and not switching between contexts</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: Just to be clear - @language in the @context only applies to strings. For TC0048 output should pick the /more specific/ term definition 'propertyLanguageNull'.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... I think switching between contexts is the most common use case</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  expansions use is not just compaction.. you also need to expand when converting to RDF</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  I think we can re-purpose expansion for RDF because RDF has no context</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... I think it's confusing to say expansion just eliminates the context without saying why</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  Is it really simpler to switch between contexts than to say that the context is removed? [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  When compacting, I apply a context to compact it again. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  maybe a better way to reorganize it would be to add a section before expansion/compaction and describe it there</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... and then just say expansion eliminates context, compaction adds one</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  does anyone thinks there are some fundamental problems in any of the current spec versions?</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  I don't think so</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... my preference would be to use alternate2 but pull in a bit more from what markus had</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... we should also pull error constant</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... we could also reorder some stuff</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  I think I support alternate2 as well</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... I found the structure more accessible and especially the inverse context algorithm easier to understand</div>

<h1 id="topic-2" class="topic">Topic: ISSUE-213: Vulnerability when loading HTTP-based JSON-LD Contexts</h1>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: <a href="https://github.com/json-ld/json-ld.org/issues/213">https://github.com/json-ld/json-ld.org/issues/213</a></div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  we found a security vuln. in payswarm that you could reverse a transaction if a remote context was manipulated</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... dns poisoning is the main problem</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... proposal is to require remote context over https</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... or to let the API define a hook which is then used to load remote contexts</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  my implementation does that</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  I would be reluctant to require HTTPs</div>

<h1 id="topic-3" class="topic">Topic: ISSUE-204: Design Issue with Relative IRIs and compaction</h1>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: <a href="https://github.com/json-ld/json-ld.org/issues/204">https://github.com/json-ld/json-ld.org/issues/204</a></div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  The issue is that it requires us to use CURIEs at the RHS instead of terms</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  here are the options we discussed last time: 1) skips terms when doing the IRI compaction or 2) appends ./ to the name if it is an HTTP IRI or 3) exposes the risk that you may accidentally compact down to a term. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Niklas Lindström</span>:  there 2 options</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... if you use relative IRIs you should use ./</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... when we auto-generate relative IRIs</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... the danger is that people might use relative IRIs without "./" and their relative IRIs clash with a term</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... e.g. "license": "licence".. would end up being a property linking to itself</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... altough we don't like adding new keywords (and we had feature-freeze).. we might should add a keyword @url for type-coercions</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... just uses relative/absolute IRIs</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  I don't understand why we need @url if we use "./"</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Niklas Lindström</span>:  we don't need it.. but it would make it simpler for people to express their intent</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  If we are going to allow terms as values in @id, does it imply that @vocab is effective in @id? [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  If we do that, then IRIs would be handled the same everywhere, which would be good. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  Let's just use @vocab on the right, in @type and @id, and make it consistent everywhere. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  in RDFa we have different rules for subjects, properties, objects</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... perhaps that doesn't make sense for JSON-LD</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... but "./" just makes sense for hierarchical IRIs.. what about all other cases?</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  Maybe there is an argument here for just having relative and absolute IRIs in @id and @type... why is @type different? [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  there are 4 cases in RDF where IRIs are used: subj, pred, obj, data type</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... pred and data type it makes sense to be vocab relative, subj, obj should be document relative</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  that makes sense</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... so @id wouldn't be vocab-relative</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: "foo": "PurchaseRequest"</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... is the vocab. every gonna be used to expand something on the right hand side of a statement</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... "@type": "PurchaseRequest"</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  we could do something like @type: @vocab</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Niklas Lindström</span>: .. I still wonder if @type: @symbol wouldn't be more useful</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Niklas Lindström</span>: .. we need a keyword which says "expand terms and curies, or resolve against @vocab"</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>: @enum</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Niklas Lindström</span>: .. "license": {"@type": "@id"}</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  The minimal change we could make is to keep everything as it is currently, plus terms, but compact them to relative IRIs if they don't collide with a term. If it collides with a term, we just keep the full IRI. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... what happens with this? "foo": "not-defined"</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... discussing @type: @vocab</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  we should also probably just allow absolute iris in context</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>: @enum is an alternative, but a new keyword.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... proposal is to just allow absolute IRIs in the context, we introduce @type: @vocab, which would interpret values just as values of @type are currently processed</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  If "@type": "@vocab" is specified for a term in the active context, then processing for @id attempts to resolve as a term first, then a CURIE, then an absolute IRI, then a document-relative IRI. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>: "term: {"@id": "…", "@type": "@vocab"}</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  we could require @vocab to be defined in that case</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  If "@type": "@vocab" is specified for a term in the active context, then processing for the value associated with the term attempts to resolve it as an IRI - first processing it as a term, then a CURIE, then an absolute IRI, then against the active @vocab (if present), then a document-relative IRI.
