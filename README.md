All minutes for the JSON-LD telecons are provided here.

## Minutes

Log location: https://www.w3.org/YYYY/MM/DD-json-ld-irc

## Usage

The IRC logs in this repo are converted to HTML via
[scrawl.js](https://github.com/json-ld/scrawl.js) which is integrated into this
repo via NPM.

First, install the tooling via...

```sh
$ npm i
```

IRC logs are not (yet) automatically downloaded, so use the following steps to
download the raw logs (change the date as needed, of course):

```sh
$ mkdir 2025-09-10
$ curl https://www.w3.org/2025/09/10-json-ld-irc > 2025-09-10/irc.log
```

If additional changes are needed, create a `changes.log` file in the dated
directory and add IRC log style entries such as...

```irc
00:00:00 <bigbluehat> scribe+
```

Then, to build the minutes and update the index (i.e. the regular use case), one
can simply run the following (changing the date to the directory in which the
`irc.log` is stored):

```sh
$ npm run build -- 2025-09-10
```

The result should be an updated `./index.html` and a new
`2025-09-10/index.html`.
