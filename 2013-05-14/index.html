<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Any updates to the agenda? [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>: <a href="https://github.com/json-ld/json-ld.org/issues/246#issuecomment-17773737">https://github.com/json-ld/json-ld.org/issues/246#issuecomment-17773737</a></div>
<div class="information">Paul Kuykendall is scribing.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  new issue brought up from link above</div>
<h1 id="topic-1" class="topic">Topic: Implementation Updates</h1>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  ruby implementation released some minor problems fixed (typos and missing steps)</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... waiting to fix missing steps for talking with markus and others</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  more tests need to be added to look for errors</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... sandro put out some additional tests as well</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  freeze test suite before going to CR</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Sandro Hawke</span>:  can add tests after we go to CR</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Sandro Hawke</span>:  we need to get people running the test suite</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  important for json-ld to be handled by most important implementations, jenna, etc.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Stian Soiland-Reyes</span>: <a href="https://github.com/jsonld-java/jsonld-java">https://github.com/jsonld-java/jsonld-java</a> has been receiving minor patches recently by ansell and tristan</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Niklas Lindström</span>:  no major movement on our part, mainly working with turtle</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Niklas Lindström</span>: his original source: <a href="https://github.com/tristan/jsonld-java">https://github.com/tristan/jsonld-java</a></div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Andy stopped working on the processor about 6 months ago because the spec was in too much flux. Tristan is working on getting it in shape in the near future</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Working on the JSON-LD normalization now. Should be in good shape for a Java implementation in the next few months</div>
<h1 id="topic-2" class="topic">Topic: RDF-ISSUE-129: Lossless conversion</h1>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: <a href="http://www.w3.org/2011/rdf-wg/track/issues/129">http://www.w3.org/2011/rdf-wg/track/issues/129</a></div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Sandro Hawke</span>:  Working on some RDF issues in patch, such as when literals match case, etc. We were losing information such that triples don't match themselves often. example in email.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... Challenge with JSON being underspecified in numbers, different parsers have different parsing mechanisms.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... Basically, we might as well convert all native number types to json numbers</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... don't convert decimal as most people use it to flag they care about exact precision</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  we had a lot of conversations regarding round-tripping with json-ld</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... idea of round tripping issues is well known. Don't use use datatypes flag in order to ensure proper data round-tripping.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Sandro Hawke</span>:  add editorial comment to highlight the warning about round-tripping data issues.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  there are some comments, but they could be highlighted better. We need to be careful to not to overly restrict data conversion 32/64 bit conversions, etc.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Sandro Hawke</span>:  don't pass around json-ld with native numbers unless you really don't care about your integrity</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  we tried to be specific in guidance. It needs to be added to the spec. This situation is very application specific</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  when data is published on the web today many assume that machine is 32bit capable.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  most web developers won't convert numbers by converting to int, etc. and marking it with the xml type</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Sandro Hawke</span>:  if you use native forms then clients may get the wrong data, should use expanded form.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Paul Kuykendall</span>:  I do think it's important that we say something in the spec, it might get lost - we're doing banking/financial apps - datatypes are very important wrt. numbers. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Paul Kuykendall</span>:  It'll be good for our data consumers to know that this is an issue. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Sandro Hawke</span>:  2 parts of proposal. first part is editorial. Use native types is "do what I mean, but I accept errors"</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... turn them into native numbers.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Sandro Hawke</span>:  the other part would be it alwas comes back as a double</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  I wonder if the flag is in the wrong place</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  perhaps there should be an expansion flag such that when we expand we turn all numeric data types into ? data types so that the consumers can choose how data is handled</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Sandro Hawke</span>:  I like that</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  it is possible to use numerical representation and not loose type/precision information on conversion.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  I have a concern about if it is round-tripable between rdf-&gt;jsonld-&gt;rdf</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... you will loose information when transforming back and forth to json-ld</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Sandro Hawke</span>:  if you don't want to lose info, don't use native</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  you never lose type information if you round-trip.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Sandro Hawke</span>:  yes you do, &lt;missed example&gt;</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>: Turtle 1 = {"@value": 1, "@type": "xsd:int"}</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  you can do a transformation and retain the type</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... the precision could be changed, but the type is retained</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... rdf - json is always using expanded form</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... only on compaction will the type information be lost</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  I don't like that we lose type information between different types. It's a non-starter</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Sandro Hawke</span>:  Wait, I thought you were saying that type information is preserved, isn't that what I'm proposing?</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  What I mean is that it is possible for the developers to better manage type conversion with the current approach. Markus' changes lose some of that fidelity.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  add option so that the developer can choose if string representation or native form is used via an option flag if the types match.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... current spec has converting to string that are missing the data type.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  we need to discuss this more with Markus and Dave on the call to talk about the changes being made. The changes have cascading effects</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  if we do make this change it would have a non-trivial change forcing another last-call</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  we haven't already entered 2nd last call</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  we can add an additional at-risk marker to keep us from having to enter a 3rd last call</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  I'll make sure it is brought up</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  need to mark it as "needs community input"</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Sandro Hawke</span>:  I haven't seen that reference, but it makes sense. please look for that reference</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  We will try and fix these issues and add an issue marker highlighting the issue, and bring it up at the RDF working group</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Sandro Hawke</span>:  we many need to refer to a different spec regarding futures - the DOM WHATWG one might change.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Sandro Hawke</span>:  hard requirement is to refer to stable things. it is hard to argue that the "living spec" is stable</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... not saying we change the reference, but change how we use the reference</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  We don't actually reference the Futures spec directly. We only use the Future concept in our spec, not the API itself.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Sandro Hawke</span>:  if they change Futures, then every piece of software using futures would be broken and have to change</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Being pedantic, but the spec wouldn't change, just the implementation.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Sandro Hawke</span>:  The director probably won't be okay with that. You shouldn't build on specs that are not stable</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... We have to hard-code it with the current view of futures so that if it changes, we use the old version of futures</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  adding two issues to the spec and will publish next tuesday</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... that gives us the chance to avoid al 3rd last-call</div>
<div class="proposal"><strong>PROPOSAL:</strong> Add issue markers to the 2nd Last Call for JSON-LD Algorithms and API to warn about how the useNativeTypes flag and algorithm might change, and to also warn about the details of referencing the DOM-WHATWG spec wrt. Futures may change.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: +1</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>: +1</div>

<div id="resolution-1" class="resolution"><strong>RESOLUTION:</strong> Add issue markers to the 2nd Last Call for JSON-LD Algorithms and API to warn about how the useNativeTypes flag and algorithm might change, and to also warn about the details of referencing the DOM-WHATWG spec wrt. Futures may change.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  I think this should include how the useNativeType flag impacts the misuse of type conversion.</div>
<h1 id="topic-3" class="topic">Topic: RDF-ISSUE-128: Mandatory profiles</h1>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Peter Ansell is asking us to make certain profiles mandatory on the server and client. He is saying that this is an inter-operability issue, which it is. We also can't force people into interop, and we do want people to be able to dip their toes into JSON-LD w/o being hit over the head by a requirement like this.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: <a href="http://www.w3.org/2011/rdf-wg/track/issues/128">http://www.w3.org/2011/rdf-wg/track/issues/128</a></div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  There is a thought that Peter might have missed the fact that we can't force people to do things they don't want to do by requiring a certain set of operations.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... if we require expanded, flattened, and compacted, then we increase the burden of server developers such that they may not want to implement the spec</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  we don't want the community to come along and say you're doing it wrong by not supporting everything in the spec</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... there are good intentions but it could hinder large corporations from dipping their toes into json-ld</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... it hurts incremental conformance of the spec</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  the proposal uses should instead of must</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Paul Kuykendall</span>:  I think it's important that profiles are not mandatory - we're just implementing just enough to get us going. At this point, we don't need mandatory profiles. We'd like to be able to say we're using JSON-LD in our marketing docs, but at this point, we don't have the need to do anything more than expand (we don't support compact / flattened). Having that club out there would be a... [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: ...detriment to us.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Paul Kuykendall</span>:  We intend to use the other formats, but at this point, we're trying to just get it done. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Paul Kuykendall</span>:  While expand was a pretty big undertaking, compact and flatten really add a lot of extra overhead that doesn't buy us any real business value. It will in the future, but right now it doesn't provide us anything. Having that club out there wouldn't be good to us. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  what Paul just said is the same feedback as what the we've gotten from larger companies in private</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... 'should' is fine verbiage rather than 'must' for implementation of spec</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  &lt;&lt;&lt; pk/ I missed gregg's comment&gt;&gt;&gt;</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  if we're in a case where Apache and Express don't follow the spec, then there is a bigger disconnect.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>: question is, can a server respond with any time, even if it doesn't match what's in the ACCEPT header.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>: … This includes type parameters, needs research.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-rdf-comments/2013May/0038.html">http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-rdf-comments/2013May/0038.html</a></div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  if the above satisfies Peter's comments then we should use that.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Niklas Lindström</span>: <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html">http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html</a></div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Niklas Lindström</span>:  it sounds like we're restating the rules of content negotiiation</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Stian Soiland-Reyes</span>: I don't think you need to do 406 if it's just the profile parameter that can't be satisfied (it might be satisfied, the server just don't know that)</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  we need to make sure we're not duplicating spec text</div>
