<h1 id="topic-1" class="topic">Topic: DrupalCon discussion on JSON-LD</h1>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/node/249128">http://groups.drupal.org/node/249128</a></div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Lin has asked what JSON-LD features should be used in Drupal.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… Two issues that were important have been re-opened: property generators and language map.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… When they were re-opened they became nervous about stability of JSON-LD.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… We need to discuss why they were re-opened, and what to do going forward.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… The message is that the features are unstable, and could go away, which is not true.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  The main reason they were opened was because the algorithms haven't been updated, and we haven't discussed how compaction works.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… In the property generators issue, there was a comment that this was supported, but the array-position wasn't.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… I thought we might want to discuss the array-position issue again.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… The main reason was to make sure that the algorithms are updated before the issue is closed.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  I had some question about our support for property generators.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Perhaps we should discuss how compaction should work.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… the main thing is to signal to Drupal that we're not pulling the rug out from under them.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… We re-opened to make sure that all the work was completed, not that the feature was in doubt.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>: <a href="https://github.com/json-ld/json-ld.org/issues/142#issuecomment-7866816">https://github.com/json-ld/json-ld.org/issues/142#issuecomment-7866816</a></div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  It's not just for drupal, we have a similar mechanism in RDFa, and other companies have indicated their need for it too.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… It's not just for drupal, but they did provide motivation.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Niklas Lindström</span>:  I understand that the mutliple-property feature could be seen as "un-pure" from a theoretical perspective. You should rely on inference and other things, but those are all ideals.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… This case supports a fairly easy way for both producers and consumers to manage such properties.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… The alternative would be to create different documents for different consumers, which isn't very useful.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… It's un-pure, but useful.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  I don't hear any objection to keeping the feature, we just need to work out details, specifically in compaction.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  We may want to say right now that it's not addressed in compaction, it would allow us to close out this particular feature. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  We could say that if we /do not/ describe anything happening in compaction, then we may not do anything. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  The algorithm for compaction would be a bit different... more heavyweight. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  I don't think we want to wrap these things together, we don't want to message that just because we haven't wrapped some of the API details up, that we're not going to support the feature. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Niklas Lindström</span>: +1 for that</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  we do a proposal that says "support both property-generators and language-maps; close issues; create new issues for compaction implications".</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  you can't make use of these things without the API, so we need all parts.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  I think we need to do the expansion... no controversy there, the issue comes in via compaction and in via framing... certainly, there is some open work to be done in the expansion algorithms. It's reasonable to link them to the existing issues. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  Our practice has been to keep issues open until the language has been updated to reflect what's done. It's a book-keeping exercise. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  we need to do something to tell them that there is a clear effort to support these features.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… The proposal is to underscore that both property generators and language maps are supported features, and the group is working out the details of how the API supports them.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  we could post on drupal that we're supporting it, the issue is resolved, but the work's not all done.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  the reason we need to be more careful on how we use the issue tracker is because the the perception on outside groups.</div>
<div class="proposal"><strong>PROPOSAL:</strong>  The group is committed to support language maps and property generators in JSON-LD 1.0.</div>

<div id="resolution-1" class="resolution"><strong>RESOLUTION:</strong> The group is committed to support language maps and property generators in JSON-LD 1.0.</div>
<h1 id="topic-2" class="topic">Topic: Property Generators and .compact() API</h1>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Markus' point is that we've typically dealt with things all in one issue, why is this different.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  I don't know where other people are wrt to this. The .compact() algorithm is getting to be almost unimplementably complex. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  It becomes almost unacceptable in an algorithm, when in-fact, most people typically generate JSON-LD through their own customized mechanisms. I do make use of compaction, but mostly as a way of doing fairly standard normalizations. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  I usually generate properties as arrays - so for example, dropping single value arrays. Making use of CURIEs, or other terms. I find compaction() useful for that stuff. I don't find .frame() useful at all. I usually do in-memory linking. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  It would be too much work to get the API to do what I wanted... noticed this in .frame(). If it doesn't work, it doesn't work and there is no insight into why. Very hard to debug frames. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  I think these things make it fairly useless, adding more complexity to .compact() is not something I'd like to do. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  Which term is selected for a specific property is one of those things. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  The ranking algorithm... the very act of splitting properties among multiple terms, is strange. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  if you have a property that has an equivalent IRI, the datatypes are split among those terms.... if you are trying to be entirely symmetric between compaction and expansion. It leads to unexpected results. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  At a high level, I agree on the complexity argument. That's one of the reasons in the beginning we said that when we talk about compaction, we leave a lot of the magic up the the implementation.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… Maybe we should define a core-set of interoperability that you should expect from compaction, but it leaves serious concerns about interoperability.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  2 questions: 1) do we expect compaction to be interoperable. 2) were do we draw the line on interoperability?</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… property generators are a case where we may not want the algorithm to do anything when it goes to compact those values.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Niklas Lindström</span>:  I also agree on a high level, especially w.r.t. property generators.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… I do see the need for ranking, and tend to think that that should be interoperable.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… The mapping from RDF to elastic search indexing of data. I'd like that to be as automatic as possible.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… From my point of view, although I agree we should debate, I feel we should draw the line at where you cannot determine what term is used from the value alone.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… That rules out property generators. Does not rule out ranking, and might not language maps, but I agree that it's on the edge.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  would we be opposed to some implementations implementing it, and others not.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  In RDFa, we have examples of optional features - implementing the feature is not required, but if it is required, it has interoperability requirements. Processor graphs is one such example. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  Maybe we have a flag that allows best-effort compaction... maybe we can have a set of parameters that are associated with these optional features. Processors can declare whether they are supported or not. They're supported if the appropriate options are passed to the algorithm. It also makes testing easier. It can also reduce the computational complexity to support odd cases that are more likely to never come about. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  In that case, maybe term selection is not optional, but it is a feature that is controlled through an API flag. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Niklas Lindström</span>:  I think flags are good for optional features. It should be possible to query the implementation via a .hasFeature() method. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Niklas Lindström</span>:  flags are good for optional features. We should have a "has feature" method, so you can take appropriate measure.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: +1 to niklasl</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  I agree with the general direction of the discussion. We're discussing two things:</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… 1) the compact call will have a mechanism to turn off or on different features.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… 2) if a processor implements a feature, it must be done in an interoperable way.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… This would indicate that compaction for property generators would not be part of the base API, but people could implement it by providing a feature driven by a flag.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  I'm wondering if, in this case, it might not be too difficult to support.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… It's difficult at the moment to distinguish between prefixes and terms, because every term can be a prefix. You could then have a prefix which would expand compact IRIs.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… if we limit other options on terms that are property generators, we could simplify compaction.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  this would modify the feature because of complexity, and give poor signals to developers.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  we currently silently ignore all other definitions for a prefix if it's also a term.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… I ran across some issues where a term was used as a prefix, or the other way, and other attributes of the term were not used.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Niklas Lindström</span>:  we could actually say that things define with an expanded term definition are never used as prefixes.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  then I would need to keep track what's a prefix or what's not.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  We might say that if it uses an expanded definition, it only uses the @id key - if that, then it can be used as a prefix. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  A term can be used as a term if it matches. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  If we require a : at the end of a prefix this creates a micro-syntax.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… This would make it work differently in the body of a document. The way we have it now, you need to understand that these terms would not be used as prefixes, but that's a detail developers need to worry about.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… If we have something with a ':' in it, the general case is that they would need to educate themselves about this.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… If we require a ':', it could be error prone. A single-character mistake could mess them up.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… I don't like this for those reasons, and I think developers would have a hard time learning about this.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Niklas Lindström</span>: .. "foaf": {"@id": "…", "@prefix": true}</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  What are the issues where this happens in common practice? The only time this becomes an issue is in something like an OWL definition. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  There are very few cases here where this happens. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Niklas Lindström</span>:  there were some issue when I did some RDFa/JSON-LD conversion; it's not clear from the context if I can use them for prefixes.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  Maybe converting from RDFa to JSON-LD... [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  the issue was how we would support property generator in compaction.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  do we think that there may be optional features in compaction?</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… If there optional features, we are going to say if you implement it, it has conformance requirements to guarantee interoperability.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… If a feature is optional, it does not need to be implemented, but if you do, it must conform.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… In practice, you know if the feature is there. It's only when you have a modular system that this is useful.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  In General, I don't like this, but there may be some cases where it's useful.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… I think the cost to processor implementors is small compared to consumer's needs.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  There is a computational concern, if these features are enabled by default, it could really slow down your workflow. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  I have to do a combinatorial search over those properties for things like property generators... that is a computational burden. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  That's for somebody that doesn't even want property generator compaction. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  Perhaps these are features where the defaults can be defined by the presence of the feature. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  the more I think about it, the more I'm concerned about the memory/computational overhead of compacting property generators.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… Drupal needs this to use core properties and be compatible with schema.org.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… The decision lies with the authors. It's not import for us to decide.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… If not you're okay with the computational issues, you can turn it on or off.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  As a consumer of data, I don't specify a context... I use what is served to me. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  Then why are we concerned about compaction if people might not use it? [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Gregg Kellogg</span>:  Because people do use .compact() and we don't want the computational complexity in the default case. [scribe assist by Manu Sporny]</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Niklas Lindström</span>:  I was thinking that if drupal started using a lot of properties for a given term, it could be that the consumers will react to that, and think that it's just noise. I wouldn't expect more than 3-5.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… If consumers want to consume such data, they can consume it incrementally, triple by triple.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  we're going to need to do some "least-resistance" proposal to make some progress.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>: Proposals on the table: 1) Support optional features in .compact(), 2) Make all features required in .compact()</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>: we already support optional features - optimize</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  if we support optional features, we're likely to support property generation is high. If all are required, property generation support is low.</div>

<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>: following along in IRC ... keep in mind that those that want to use the feature (eg: drupal) might shy away from JSON-LD anyway if they think it's "optional" (the compaction side of it)</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>: it needs to be sold that a processor that they can use will implement it ... otherwise what good is it?</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>: that said, i'm ok with the optional path, just pointing out (if it hasn't been) a possible issue.</div>

<h1 id="topic-3" class="topic">Topic: Alternative to combinatorial .compact()</h1>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>: maybe a better solution would be to mark which term you want to use in the compaction, in the @context, so the compaction algorithm can just look there and pick it.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>: that's really what i think people would want anyway ... instead of having to think through the algorithm in their minds</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>: and guess which term will be selected based on whichever combination is most efficient.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>: {"@context": {"foo": {"compact: true", ... (other stuff here) ... }}</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>: that would make compaction super simple ... and it would do what you want.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  you have a document with a property generator already in compact form.</div>

<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>: {"@context": {"foo": {"compact: true", ... (other stuff here) ... }}</div>

<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>: "foo": {"@id": "whatever", ... property generator ..., "compact": true}</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  the problem has always been that you need to understand the algorithm. This allows you to be more clear and not have deep understanding.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… We could put the ranking algorithm into the context. You could be very explicit about what terms to pick.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  my concern is that it's pretty complex, in that it doesn't hide any of the complexity from the developer.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… it's much more complicated than the other features.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  if you want to be specific, then you only need to specify one.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>: "foo": {"@id": [any match in here], "compact": true}</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>: "foo": {"@id": [any match in here], "compact": 1}</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>: "foo": {"@id": [any match in here], "compact": 5}</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  one of the issues is knowing what term to pick.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  I thought the way the algorithm was supposed to work is that every id must exist with the same value. Then and only then do you use foo.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… what we're trying to do here is say how property generators are round-tripped.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… this is a new way to do compaction.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  I think dave's option is interesting, but it is tangentially related to property generator compaction.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  do they really care about this?</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… I would think that, in the general case, I want to say that all these properties mean the same thing. If that's true, I don't think we need the extra complexity.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  if the intention is to generate multiple properties when you see a single key, I don't see there's an issue.</div>

<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  this could send mixed messages to the drupal community.</div>

<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  it's more like we're fighting for their feature. We should ask them how they feel about 5)</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>: don't really understand 5) to be honest... the way I would implement this is to rank a term for each of it @id's in compaction and leave all the rest the same</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  this takes us into entailment, and we should tread carefully.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>: +1 to 1) -1 to 2) +0.5 to 3) +0 to 4) +1 to 5)</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… If we start to add ranking flags, we should be careful.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  1) seems to have the strongest support.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  I'm worried that people may feel this is license to not implement.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  once people see an implementation (PHP), they'll be fine with it.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  I can try an implementation of 1) to see how easy it is</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  the only way for the algorithm to work is if you check both properties and values (for 1)</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… when you expand "foo", it might expand into 3 different IRIs.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... However, if when you expand, you might have something that maps.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>: "foo": [ "a", "b" ] - foo: data - expand - a: data, b: data - compact - foo: data, data ??? Remove duplicates, round-trip OK?</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>:  you could end up choosing the wrong term, and create more data.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… multiple property generators are even worse.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… you might then need the ranking algorithm.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Markus Lanthaler</span>:  we already have that problem. if you have two properties that map to the same IRI, they might not compact back the same.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  maybe a callback could help.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  for the drupal case, they definitely want to generate multiple properties on expansion.</div>
<div class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  we need to reach out to the drupal community about this.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">… I'll touch base with Lin and Stephane about this.</div>
